            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

In th'Author, two things, beſides his exact knowledge in Civill and Divine affairs, are very remarkable; his Love to Truth, and Hatred to Detraction: As to Truth, he holds it forth, as the beſt &amp; moſt permanent Policy for Princes, and their Miniſters of State. <hi>Buy the Truth, but ſell it not,</hi> ſaies <hi>Solomon. Magna eſt Veritas, &amp; praevalebit.</hi> As to Detraction, he condemns the practice of it in all perſons, and gives th'example t'others. For he is ſparing in the diſcovery of ſome ſharp Truths, and permits the Matter, Errours, or Crimes, to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh the men. And it were to be wiſhed, that perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall obloquie were not as modeable in our daies, as new dreſſes.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:99746:3"/>
            <p> In the buſineſſe of Religion, he may be found zealous, but not ſuperſtitious, and rather of the <hi>Gallican,</hi> then <hi>Papall</hi> perſwaſion. Deceits and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are decryed by him, in what ſubject ſoever he finds them; Piety and Vertue highly exalted. For he made them, if report be true, his daily exerciſe; as knowing, that nothing can be perpetuall, but what is founded upon Piety or Vertue: for they are equall in the Ballance, when Vices endure no equality. And being bred in the School of that <hi>emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and ſucceſsfull Cardinall of Richlieu,</hi> and cheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in his Converſation and Houſe, did collect the moſt reſined products of his Policy, Wit, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, and gather the choiceſt Flowers of his Garden.</p>
            <p>The Book had a very high eſteem in <hi>France,</hi> at the publication in <hi>Paris,</hi> and hath juſtified its cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit in the preſent uſe, as an approved Jewell; and it cannot go leſſe in value here, where Learning and good Wits abound, and the judgment of diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a true Diamond from a Pibble ſtone, though never ſo well ſet; equall, if not ſuperiour, to any Nation of the World.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have ſome Conſiderations to repreſent unto thee concerning this VVork, whereupon I beſeech thee to caſt thy eyes. The firſt is in relation to the Matter, which is compoſed of Reaſonings and Examples. As to the Reaſonings, thou ſhalt know them to be wholly mine, and a pure product of my witt, and by conſequence imperfect, and taſtes of the weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the principle from which it is derived. When I diſcourſe of paſt Occurrences, and of things hapned in the Raignes of the King, If the true motives have not alwaies been encountred by me, nor the eſſentiall cauſes of their ſucceſſe; I have nothing to ſay to thee, but that I had not the ſpirit of Divination; That I have not received remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances or inſtructions from any perſon; And that th'Actions of Princes are like great Rivers, the beginning and ſprings whereof ſew perſons have ſeen, though an infinite of perſons ſee the courſe and progreſſe of them.</p>
            <p>If any perſon thinks my Judgement too free, chiefly when I ſpeake of the <hi>Pope</hi> and the matters of <hi>Rome,</hi> I beſeech him to conſider that gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler Conſequences cannot be drawn from th'Examples that are brought; If th'examples are falſe, I have not invented them; the ſprings are well knowne: There's cauſe nevertheleſſe to praiſe God that ſome of the Paſtors who have governed his Church have not been ſo black as they are painted. If they are true, there's cauſe to admire the Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence in preſerving his Church from decay and ſpot, in the time of corruption of ſome of its members, and in maintaining of it in health, the plague being ſo neer it. That is to ſay, as I underſtand it, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was altered of the meanes which God hath appointed to guide us to our ſupernaturall end. That the Doctrine of Faith which is one of the Principles that makes us act Chriſtianly, and which hath workes for her neareſt end, is alwaies the ſame. That the Sacraments which conferr and increaſe grace in us by virtue of the Inſtitution of Jeſus Chriſt, and not by virtue of what we bring unto it of ours, as of a meritorious cauſe, are not changed for the number, their matter, or their forme; That the permanent and incorruptible State in theſe two things is found only
<pb facs="tcp:99746:4"/>in that holy Hierarchy which makes that myſticall Body of Jeſus Chriſt; which is compoſed of a head that repreſents it, and of many principall &amp; ſubalterne members who hold of that head, and with an admirable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency and union amongſt themſelves. That it never hapned that this Head, and thoſe members to whom it belongs to guide others, have together, and with a common conſent, fayled againſt theſe two things; and that it will never happen to th'end of the world, at leaſt if the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of God are eternall, and his word unchangeable; and therefore no perſon is to wonder, if out of the Church there be no ſalvation, ſince the Church only containes that means that brings us thither, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves inviolable the ſubſtance and number of the Sacraments, and the purity of th'Evangelicall doctrine. Moreover, and for what reſpecteth every member of the Church in particular, That God hath left them in the hands of their counſell to beleeve or live as they pleaſe; that hee hath put before them fire and water, that they may make their choyce, and that he impoſeth no neceſſity upon them, but leaves them be power of their will, that's to ſay, the power to follow that good or to forſake it, to doe evill or to abſtaine from it.</p>
            <p>When I ſpeake then with liberty of the vices of ſome <hi>Popes,</hi> and of the corruption of ſome of their Agents; I doe not thinke to wrong Religion, nor to offend the Church. The Cardinall <hi>Baronius</hi> relates, with much more ſoverity or leſſe allay then I doe, the abuſes which overſtowed the Court of Rome when two famous whores <hi>Theodoſia,</hi> and <hi>Moroſia,</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned it, and the Popes of that time; A man muſt not alwaies ſet himſelfe againſt known truths: Who ſupport ill cauſes loſe their credit, &amp; make themſelvs to be ſuſpected, when they have good ones to defend; &amp; reſemble certain perſons who being equally honeſt to all the world are not ſo to any perſon; and putting neither difference nor meaſure to their civilities, and treating with the ſame honours and complements, the perſons of ſmall merit and baſe condition, oblige not ſo much the one as they wrong th'others. Nevertheleſſe if I am not deceived, I doe exerciſe ſuch a moderation in ſpeaking of Popes, and ſo well ſupport what is of Gods inſtitution in condemning what proceeds from the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and from the corruption of man, that I am ſo farre from beleeving my ſelfe guilty of blame, that I think, without vaunt, to have merited ſomewhat from the Holy Chayre, if without paſſion judgement be paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon me. Howſoever if I flatter my ſelfe in my apprehenſions, and if the love of my worke deceives me, I ſubmit with a compleat ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the judgement of Superiours, and of them who have power to regulate my opinions, and to impoſe lawes upon my underſtanding. What they ſhall condemne, I condemne it; I doe now retract what they ſhall not eſteeme good, and I have not ſo little of Chriſtianity as not to know that tis better to obey and exerciſe a neceſſary vertue, then to make a noyſe in the world and gaine a vaine reputation of ſpirit, in defending an ambiguous Opinion. Let this be ſaid in paſſing-by, and by way of prevention.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:99746:4"/>
            <p> As for the Examples which make out th'other part of the matter of this work; I adviſe thee Reader, that if the Authors from whom I have taken them are deceived, I will not be their ſecurity: If I have miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken my ſelfe in what I have taken from them, I confeſſe freely that that fault is voluntary; that 'tis a defect for which a remedy might have been found in conſulting with knowing men or bookes, but that I have not done it for want of leiſure or induſtry: If any perſon take it ill that I doe make ſo frequent uſe of Spaniſh Examples, I beſeech him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that I doe it for two or three reaſons. The firſt, that its the French humour to be more ſenſible of ſtrange things than them of their country. The ſecond, in ſo much that they will ſerve the more to make knowne the Conduct of the Spaniards; which is a neceſſary knowledge to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents of other Princes, ſince that Nation holds other Chriſtian nations in perpetuall exerciſe, and obligeth them to be with her or againſt her. The third, inſomuch that, ſpeaking generally, that Nation underſtands th' Art to governe and command men better then any Nation in the world. If I ſpeak in many places with prayſe of S. the Cardinall; bee it conſidered apart from the intereſt of any perſon, that I take nothing from another to give to him: That I do attribute alwaies to the King the chiefe glory of good ſucceſſe; That I doe repreſent him as the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall and firſt cauſe of the good fortune of <hi>France,</hi> and that the prayſes which <hi>I</hi> give to S. the Cardinall, are applyed unto him in ſuch a manner that they rebound nevertheleſſe upon the King. That I condemne not in particular any living perſon. That I commend others whom J meet with in my diſcourſe who deſerve it, and give honour to vertue whereſoever I finde it: That I doe report what paſſed under the Government of that great Miniſter of State by way of Example, and as I doe relate the Actions of a <hi>Ferrand Gonſalve,</hi> or of a <hi>Gaſton of Foix,</hi> of a <hi>Prince of Parma,</hi> or of a <hi>Duke of Guyſe,</hi> that I adde nothing to th' Actions; that I ſpeake not but of the things wee have touched and ſeene, whereof our ſenſes are Judges, and whereunto all Nations give Evidence. I doe but reaſon upon it, let it be examined whether my reaſonings are weake and ill grounded: and if they who take offence have better Moralls and better Politiques then mine; I doe not pretend to hinder them of the light or of the value they ſhall put upon them; with theſe Precautions. It cannot be thought ſtrange that I prayſe a Perſon who hath rendred ſo great Services to the King, which are known to all the world, who hath ſo much merited of the State and of Religion; that our Neighbours and they that love us not, have an infinite eſteeme for him; and that he is my Maſter.</p>
            <p>It remains to ſpeake of the forme of the Worke, which is the ſtyle: Whereupon, <hi>Reader,</hi> I doe timely adviſe thee that I am not enflamed with eloquence: That I have laboured Things more then Words: That I have not read <hi>Quintilian,</hi> nor the Rhetorique of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it be that part where he ſpeakes of the paſſions of Men, and of the affections of divers Ages. And therefore, if there
<pb facs="tcp:99746:5"/>be any thing that reliſhes of this Art, know that it entred by chance, and ſlipped in by accident: That 'tis a plant that growes of it ſelfe, and without being ſet; and that I have done like the needle of a Watch which markes the howers, without knowing of it. Notwithſtanding I confeſſe that I have not neglected to give it ornaments after my faſhion; that's to ſay, naturall; and that I had ſtrewed more flowers if J had had them, or more leaſure to have gathered them; Thou mayſt finde there ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality, and ſome places that are not ſo ſtrong or ſo well digeſted as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. But 'tis, that all the matters or the manner wherewith they ought to be handled are not capable of the ſame force and graces. Forgoes much better, when the ſubject carries us, and that we have wind and tide, then when we cannot move but by the ſtrength of Armes and Oares. And the Maiſters of fortifications ſay, that there are places upon the Earth which cannot be made ſtrong; not for want of Art, but by reaſon of the vitious platforme and ſituation.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the courſe of Affairs, 'tis certain, that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes onely are in the power of man, and that all Events are diſpoſed by ſome Power above him, and which being infinitely wiſe, doth nothing by Chance. Th'hazard, to which ſo many things are attributed, is a work of our brain, and none of the Principles of governing the World. All things are guided without our help, in Light and Juſtice; and the blind goddeſſe, that is called <hi>Fortune,</hi> is a fancy, which Philoſophy hath not adored, and Religion hath aboliſhed in the deſtruction of Idolatry. Th' invention nevertheleſſe hath not been unprofitable. The miſerable, charge the cauſes of their miſery upon it; and th' impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, th' effects of their ill conducts: Her name is in the mouths of all perſons, the wiſe and unwiſe do equally em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy it; and uſe is made of it ſometimes, to be the better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, and not to depart from a received cuſtome, nor from the tearms that are practiſed. But to declare what 'tis; The Power we ſpeak of, is no other thing, than God himſelf; inſomuch that he undertakes the government of free cauſes,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:99746:6"/>and diſpoſeth of them to his ends, whether they be confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to theirs, or contrary to them. And as the firſt <hi>Mobile,</hi> without deſtroying the naturall motion of the other Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, doth make them ſubject to his, and carries them from th' Eaſt to the Weſt, ſo God doth manage in ſuch ſort the actions of the Creatures, which work with liberty, that without violating their freedom, and by the encounter of other cauſes, wherein he doth caſt them, infallibly drawes th' effect which he propoſed to himſelf, and which from hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane foreſight is often litle expected.</p>
                  <p>In a word, the workman that obſerves the rules of his Art, is never diſappointed of his intention; the Painter, that perfectly underſtands the mixtures of Colours, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions of Figures, drawes at pleaſure exquiſite Pictures; th' Architect, that caſts his deſignes by the rules of Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture, makes them happily to proſper. But the faireſt ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of Man, wherein his nobleſt part hath moſt intereſt, are not ſolely capable of attaining their end, and th' effect aimed at. <hi>Hannibal</hi> acted the full duties of a brave Captain, and yet was overcome by <hi>Scipio. Cicero</hi> forgets nothing of the charge of an excellent Oratour, yet <hi>Milon</hi> was condemned; and <hi>André Doria</hi> ſees the Fleet of his Maſter periſh in the Port of <hi>Argiers.</hi> notwithſtanding his skill and experience in Maritime affairs. But what God addes to the Principles that are in us, th' occaſions which He cauſeth to ariſe for us, the means which he ſuſcitates, th' obſtacles which he diverts in our favour, and all th' aſſiſtance which He gives us, to make our deſires to proſper, is, that which we call, Good fortune, and them, Happy, which receive it. But this good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe doth not alwaies accompany Juſtice, and Holy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes, as God doth not alwaies oppoſe unjuſt and violent deſignes; th' Inſidells have often triumphed over th' Armies of Chriſtians, and of Catholieks. The moſt holy of our Kings hath been unhappy in his two Voyages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Seas; and the Cauſe of God, for which he made War, and th' Intereſt of Religion, could not ſecure him from priſon, nor from the plague. On the contrary, nothing is reád comparable to the ſucceſſe of Uſurpators; nothing put a ſtop to <hi>Alexander</hi>'s ſucceſſes, but his death; and a Prince, for whoſe ambition the world was too little, and that had the vanity to think, that there was not matter enough therein for his courage; had fortune ſo favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, that ſhe covered his faults, and rendred his failings happy. <hi>Caeſar</hi> had moſt ſucceſſe, in the moſt unjuſt War he ever made, he had no more to do than to go and conquer, in diſſipating the <hi>Romane</hi> Common-wealth. She that gave the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:99746:6"/>Law to all the Earth, fell, in leſſe time, than is laid out in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of a City; and three years have deſtroyed the works of many ages. <hi>Attila</hi> and <hi>Tamberlain</hi> have paſſed like light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in their conqueſts; and the Race of <hi>Ottomans,</hi> which takes away Religion from God, and liberty from men, hath obtained ſo many victories, and extended ſo far Its Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, for theſe hundred years and upwards, that no for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne force ſeemes ſufficient and capable for the preſent, to abate the forces of that Empire; and that it hath nothing more to fear but its own greatneſſe and exceſſive powers. The reaſon of this diverſity is, that God doth not alwaies work miracles, and diſorders not the order of things for the love of honeſt men; and as it is very reaſonable to rayſe their courage and confirme their hopes, that God ſhould ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times viſibly haſten to their releife, it is alſo moſt conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the lawes of his providence, and to the ſweetneſſe of his conduct, that ſecond cauſes be ſuffred for the moſt part to act according to their capacity and extent of their force: and therefore, in order to that, the weake to give way to the ſtronger; that a leſſer virtue, politique I meane, obey the greater; and that they, who have notorious advantages of their enemies, have alſo upon them notorious ſucceſſe: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe truly he ſhould oblige himſelfe to repaire all the faults of them who have good intentions. And if goodneſſe alone ſhould be ſucceſsfull in the world, prudence ſhould be bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed from the civill life, and induſtry from the trayne of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires.</p>
                  <p>As to the ſucceſſes of Uſurpators, It is eaſie to give the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, if we ſearch cauſes of the change of States, and of the Revolution of Empires. Tis certaine that the greateſt &amp; moſt Extended are not alwaies the firmeſt, nor the moſt durable: on the contrary, as the moſt delicate fruits are ſooner ſpoyled then others, and a perfect health is an inſtance of a diſeaſe approaching; it happens alſo that States which are in the flower of their force, and at the laſt round of their happineſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, are not farre from their fall; Pleaſure enters with wealth; power produceth ambition, &amp; theſe two paſſions, which aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect alwaies their ends without exception to meanes, draw with them ſo many other evills, that of neceſſity thoſe unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py States muſt periſh &amp; be tranſlated into a new form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; In this fatall conjuncture, if a perſon of courage &amp; of ambition to conquer, take Armes, he finds the matter rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy prepared; God ſeconds his deſigne, and abandons them unto him whom ambition had divided, and whom delicacies had deprived of Judgement, and affeminated their courage, not that he doth inſpire the conquerors with unjuſt thoughts
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:99746:7"/>nor with thoſe furious motions which thruſt them on to u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurp what belongs to others, and to violate the rights of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſociety; but acted of their owne accord, and by their owne election, he may lawfully favour them; and his juſtice will not ſuffer many good actions of theirs to paſſe unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded, nor them unpuniſhed who have abuſed his graces.</p>
                  <p>But when he makes choice of a perſon to repaire the diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the world, or for the good of a particular State; Then his care is ſhewed in furniſhing him with neceſſary princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to undertake great matters. The thoughts are put in his ſoule by God, and he gives the power to execute them; he troubles and confounds his enemies, and leades him as by the hand to victories and triumphs; and one of the greateſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedients whereof he ſerves himſelfe for this purpoſe, is, to rayſe unto him, excellent men, to whom he communicates his cares, and who help him to beare the weight of Affaires.</p>
                  <p>And as the operations of the ſoul do themſelves good or ill according to the conditions of the organs and quality of their temper; the proſperity or adverſity of Princes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on them, in whoſe hands their authority is placed, and who diſpoſe of their power. <hi>Alexander</hi> had never conquered <hi>Aſia,</hi> nor made the <hi>Indiaes</hi> to tremble but for <hi>Epheſtion, Parme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo,</hi> and <hi>Clytus; Caeſar</hi> gained many battails by the hands of his Lieuſtenants; and the fayreſt Empire of the world which ambition and ill of the times had divided into three parts, was reduced under the dominion of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of <hi>Mecaenas,</hi> and by the Valour of <hi>Agrippa; Juſtinian</hi> tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed over <hi>Perſia,</hi> and deſtroyed the <hi>Vandals</hi> in <hi>Africa,</hi> and the <hi>Goths</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> by the aide of <hi>Belliſarius</hi> and <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cete.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Count of <hi>Dunois, Pothon,</hi> the <hi>Hire,</hi> and the Mayde <hi>Jane</hi> delivered <hi>France</hi> from the invaſion of the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> And the firſt Man of the paſt-age of whom it may truly be reported, that he was too happy for a Chriſtian Prince, hath by his conduct, or with the ayde of his Miniſters of State, taken <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Thunis,</hi> a Pope, a King of <hi>France;</hi> given chaſe to <hi>Salyman,</hi> and made it appeare to <hi>Germany</hi> that it was to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered. That very Prince who was ſo intelligent in all things, and had added ſo many acquired qualities to the gifts of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, tooke the liberty to tell his Son in preſenting to him the Secretary <hi>Eraſo,</hi> that he gave him ſome-what that was greater than his States, and than the Crownes which he had reſigned unto him. By ſuch ſort of perſons, Principalities and Monarchies have been firſt founded. And for the love of them the people have voluntarily renounced their Liberties; and they are the perſons who renew alſo under their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:99746:7"/>the naturall and primitive order of command, and of that obedience which is amongſt men: And truly 'twas very reaſonable (ſince a difference ought to be made amongſt them) that Merit ſhould begin to make it: The Society to which they are born, and without which they cannot ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, is a Conſort ſo delicate, and a Fabrick compoſed of ſo many pieces, that if it be not guided by a dextrous prudence, and maintained by a ſoveraign vertue, a very little thing confounds and diſorders it.</p>
                  <p>And inſomuch that they who attain to ſuch a condition are Extraordinary, but not Immortal, and have not alwaies ſucceſſors of their virtue, as they have of their dignity; It happens ordinarily that they leave, in favour of the people, a repreſentation of their reaſon, and as a Monument of their Philoſophy, The Laws and good Orders: And again, becauſe all Laws are not good in all times, and that they cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide againſt all occurrences and the accidents of life; 'tis neceſſary that he raiſe alſo ſome wiſe Perſon, whoſe pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence may ſupply the defects, and give them ſuch a juſt tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and wholeſome proportion as may beſt fit the Time, Men, and Affairs.</p>
                  <p>'Tis then a moſt certain truth, that good Miniſters of ſtate are the glory of their Princes, and happineſs of the people: on the contrary, the wicked are the ſhame of throne, and diſpair of th'other: They are the naturall principles of the Corruption of States; all ill humours are awakened under their conduct; they ſerve for pretence, to the ſpight of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented, and to the diſturbance of factious perſons; and the people who are troubled to permit the Government of honeſt men, are carried to Licenſe, and enclined to Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, when they fall under the power of thoſe who are diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt. It ſeems to them that 'tis enough to have one Maſter, to whom neceſſary obedience ought to be paid, and whoſe yoak God doth oblige them to carry how grievous ſoever it be made; but to obey them who are not their Soveraigns when they do them hurt, when they triumph in their vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and nouriſh themſelves in their blood; 'Tis a ſad ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity for them, and a hard eſſay of patience. In effect, <hi>If</hi> Ariſtotle <hi>hath defined a Tyrant to be, The perſon who hath his pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar intereſt more before his eyes, then the good of his ſubjects;</hi> Into the hands of how many Tyrants do the miſerable people fall, when they are governed by corrupt Miniſters of State? and nevertheleſſe 'tis a Flayl which they ſeldom want; And as the Prince looks upon the State as a Wife that belongs to him, and which cannot be taken from him: There are Miniſters of State to be found, who caſt their eyes upon

                  <p>'TIs not ſtrange that ſo few honeſt men are found in the frequent occaſions of ſinning; not that the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of governing ſhould be ſo rare when 'tis ſo difficult. The reaſon of State which is the matter, is ſo perplexed and ambiguous, and th'affairs have ſo many lights which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found our ſight, that 'tis no wonder, if we are often troubled to chuſe our party; and if the choyce made in ſo great a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion be rather a ſtroak of chance, and triall of our liberty, than a rational election; Moreover the greateſt part of politick precepts which are left us, and reduced into a forme of ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, are ſuch abſtruſe things, that if Nature or Experience give not the art of Application, they become pernicious or vain; inſtead very often of making an able man, they make onely a Pedant, they communicate preſumption rather then wiſdome, they make many to wander, rather then diſcover unto them the neareſt way; and for an uncertain reformation which they promiſe, they confound and alter all things by the novelties they introduce. The way alſo by Examples, is ſo deceitfull, and the paſt makes ſo ill a judgement of the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that no certainty can be raiſed out of it: And as two Faces equally beautiful, or two Dayes of compleat reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance are rarely ſeen; ſo the condition of affairs is alwaies various, where the Vertue of the perſons that mannage them is not alike, nor their fortune equall. And again, as there's not much cauſe for him to deliberate, who hath not two faces, nor a party to follow, nor reaſons to diſpoſe him; There are none alſo, who want examples and accidents to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour them.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Pope,</hi> the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Milan,</hi> and the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Naples</hi> make a league againſt <hi>Florence:</hi> To divert the tempeſt, <hi>Larance</hi> of <hi>Medicis,</hi> ſeeks the laſt; caſts himſelf at his diſcretion, and by that brave confidence withdrawes him from the league, and prevents the lightning that was ready to fall, and might have burned his Country.</p>

                     <hi>Charles</hi> the eighth entred <hi>Italy</hi> like a <hi>Torrent,</hi> which drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all that it encountred; nothing made reſiſtance; and <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> that was on his way trembled for fear of her liberties.

                  <p>When the Sr. of <hi>Lautree</hi> undertook th'enterpriſe of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, Hugo Moncado</hi> reſolved to defend onely the City, and to abandon the reſt of the Kingdom. The Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> took a contrary courſe, when the Sr. of <hi>Groyſe</hi> aſſaulted him there, and by th'advice of <hi>Ferrand Gonſalve,</hi> reſolved to diſpute all, and to deſtroy us by a multitute of Sieges; both reſolutions proſpered, and two very different Counſells had the ſame end, and the ſame effect, The victory. There have been ſome whoſe ſingle preſence, and firſt words, have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly appeaſed th'inſurrection of the people. And there have been others whom this monſter hath ſuddenly devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, to whom they have not given the leaſure to ſpeak nor to open the mouth. How often by this meanes hath <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Germanicus</hi> appeaſed the tumults of the Souldiers, and the ſedition of Armies? And how many others have periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſame way, whoſe ſight enflamed the humours that were but moved, enraged thoſe that were but provoked, and cauſed in them a deſire of ſatiating themſelves with their blood, who before murmured onely againſt their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments. In like manner they that have condemned <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the third for leaving <hi>Paris</hi> in that notorious revolt, which is called the <hi>Baricados,</hi> have at leaſt left as much cauſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt their judgement as they had to condemn a Prince; who choſe rather to retire, then to expoſe himſelfe to an evill that had no remedy if it happened; who permitted his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to be felons, rather then to put them in a condition of being Patricides; and that would not willingly ſuffer their faults to be compleated, nor that the greatneſs of their crimes ſhould make them ſeek, in the death of him they had offended, impunity, which they believed was not to be found in his clemency: But 'tis the errour of the greateſt part of men, to exclaim alwaies againſt th'unfortunate: There's no diſgrace, whereof they that ſuffer it are not guilty in the opinion of the people. Of all the expedients which they had in hand, they were the beſt which they had quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, when thoſe they had taken did not proſper; and no old man ever dyed, were he never ſo decayed or decrepit, to whom his life had not been lengthned; if ſuch a thing had
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:99746:9"/>not been done, or ſome other thing had been done. And though it thus fall our, it muſt nevertheleſs be confeſſed, that nothing doth ſooner poliſh a well compoſed underſtanding, then Policy and Hiſtory, nor that any thing is more profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for it then converſation with the dead, and abſent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: therein he knows in a little time th'affairs of all Ages; there he enjoyes the experience of all the great perſons that have preceded; and there alſo he finds lights which hinder him often to fall, and which make out the dangers unto him which he ought to paſs; and th'ambuſhes which he ought to avoid: at leaſt by the favour of Books and Studies, he gains that which prepares him againſt ſurpriſes. And ſudden acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, give not him the diſturbance they give to ignorant perſons; ſince nothing is ſo near unto him, whereof he hath not read ſomething approaching, or like unto it. The life of man is ſo ſhort, or ſo vexed, that it hardly holds out for five or ſix important Negotiations; and ordinarily they who have but the ſingle common ſenſe to act, ceaſe to live, or have not health when they have experience: on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, they whom ſtudie prepares, and are guided by Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, proſper quickly if they meet with very profitable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. They are dextrous ſo ſoon as they touch upon bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe, and have the ſame advantage over the firſt; as in Painting, they have, who enjoy the ſcience of Deſign and Proportion, over them who have nothing of Acquiſition when they begun to paint. Of this, we have, without going from the modern time, illuſtrious examples, and eminent perſons. <hi>Monlue,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Valence,</hi> under <hi>Francis</hi> the ſecond, and under <hi>Charles</hi> the ninth. <hi>Pinai,</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>Lyons,</hi> under <hi>Henry</hi> the third; and the <hi>Cardinal</hi> of <hi>Oſſat,</hi> under the ſame Prince, and under <hi>Henry</hi> the Great, have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummated almoſt aſſoon in buſineſſe, as known in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cills: And for the war, the Marqueſs of <hi>Peſcary,</hi> who was ſo brave, and whom the League of <hi>Italy</hi> judged worthy to be oppoſed to <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, when he was moſt happy. The laſt Prince of <hi>Orenge,</hi> whoſe life had been too glorious if it had been ſhorter, and if fortune had ſuffered him to have periſhed in the relief of <hi>Bergen Opſon.</hi> The Marqueſs of <hi>Spinela,</hi> who deſerved at firſt to command th'Armies of <hi>Spain,</hi> and to be the Rivall of the laſt Prince of <hi>Orenge</hi> in military ſcience: The greateſt number of theſe great perſons, I ſay, owe to Books, a part of the honour which they have gained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out watching, and of that high reputation which they have ſo timely obtained.</p>
                  <p>But why ſhould we ſearch into the Age paſt, and amongſt ſtrangers for proofs of this truth? ſince we have them ſo
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:99746:9"/>clear and viſible in the perſon of <hi>Sr. the Cardinal of Bichlieu:</hi> 'Tis true, that Nature hath given him all ſhe had to give, to make him perfect; &amp; that ſhe hath powred out upon him with ful hands, her favour and riches. But 'tis true alſo, that he hath laboured very hard to compleat himſelfe, and that ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and meditation have acquired unto him almoſt all that was wanting to nature, and all that could be expected from experience. Th'affairs have ſerved more for matter to his underſtanding in the exerciſe of it, than for occaſion to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct it: He knew how to command before he had ever obeyed; and there's nothing ſo great in Peace and Warre, which was difficult unto him, when he had undertaken it. We will make, God aſſiſting, in another place an expreſs diſcourſe of the profits of knowledge.</p>

And that what is moſt conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the dignity of Man, hold alſo the firſt rank in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, and be the principall object of his cares, and the chiefeſt endeavour of his life. In this order conſiſts his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and naturall felicity. The contrary, that's to ſay, when the compoſition hath ſo obſtructed th'underſtanding, and ſeized upon the faculties, that it becomes ſlave to the body, makes out a fearfull confuſion, and a lamentable <hi>Anarchy.</hi> The middle condition is a ſtate of civil War, wherein com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon perſons are alwaies engaged, and from which wiſe men are not ever exempted. 'Tis betwixt reaſon and paſſions, th'one whereof is the property of th'underſtanding, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides in the chiefeſt place of the ſoul: And th'others are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the low Region, and in that brutall capacity which follows onely th'impreſſions of ſenſe, and is concerned one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the good of th'Animal part. They are raiſed and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed, as th'object that provokes is violent and rapid. But 'tis not neceſſary, that in themſelves there ſhould be that violence and force which ſtirs up th'appetite; it ſufficeth, that 'tis received in th'imagination where it enters. There it takes the forme and the colour as pleaſeth to that fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick faculty; there it ſwels or abates, as it ſeems good to that Fool. In one place it communicates joy, in another it raiſeth ſadneſs: Now 'tis but an Atome, which is hardly felt, and which doth but ſcarcely touch upon the ſuperficies of the ſoul; and in four moments after 'tis a Monſter, which teares and divides it into pieces, which makes havoke in all its powers, and which brings trouble even to the Will which it would corrupt, and even to Reaſon alſo which it endeavours to ſuborne; ſo certain is it, that the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſupple and various, and that things act not in us ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Their meaſure, but according to Hers. 'Tis true, that the objects which are agreeable to the ſenſe, and promiſe them their felicity, are to be feared. And there's no imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation ſo weighty nor dull, which is not raiſed; nor appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite ſo cold and ſo mortified, which is not heated; moreover the diſturbance is ſometimes ſo great, and the tempeſt ſo furious, that it is not in the power of the ſoul to quiet it: but in caſe ſhe ſtand firm in the deſire of good, which is moſt convenient for her, and whereof ſhe hath made choice; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is alwaies on her ſide, and to overcome; It ſufficeth not to be overcomne, and to diſſent from preſſing temptations. In concluſion, after many combats and defeats of ſuch na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſhe will remain peaceable, the lights of the Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhall be abated. The Appetite ſhall have no force longer to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:99746:10"/>rebel, Reaſon will raign with reſiſtance, and the man that is arrived to ſuch a ſtate, deſerves of naturall right to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before other men: lets paſs further.</p>
                  <p>The Morall requires not onely Man within himſelfe, and engaged in the diſorders of the body and ſpirit of reaſon and paſſions; but conſiders him alſo in his converſation and in the Crowd. For that end he teacheth him a vertue, which is called Juſtice, which inſtructs him to live well with his Neighbour, and inclines him to render unto him what is his due, and which for the preſent is wholly almoſt imployed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the diviſion of Riches, and th'introduction, which hath been made in the world, of Mine and Thine. Introduction nevertheleſs very neceſſary for the good of ſociety, for the ornament of the civill life, and for the plenty of all ſuch things as are commodious for man. The Legiſlators and Founders of States, have regulated this juſtice; and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that ſhe appeared to them a little too much in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and that it ſeemed to them a very dangerous thing to leave the conduct thereof to every mans judgement and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination: they have bounded her in certain Laws &amp; cuſtoms which they have made: they have eſtabliſhed publique per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to diſtribute it; they have put the ſword into their hand to make men affraid of it, and have given it a ſcabberd with the name of a Prince, and of his Authority, to gain it the more reſpect.</p>
                  <p>But inſomuch that notwithſtanding the great care hath been taken to adjuſt the Rule, it remaines imperfect, and that the foreſight of humane underſtanding is not ſo great as the variery of caſes which interpoſe in Traffique; an honeſt man will not ſtay there, he will have recourſe alſo for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulating of his actions, and forming of his life to the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Equity, and to the firſt ſpring of Juſtice, which is the Law of nature, or to walk after a more certain guid, and by a light free from corruption; he will follow the dictates of Religion and motions of Charity, which is the end of Chriſtianity, which is the fulneſſe of other Laws, and the definitive meaſure of all good things. He muſt have a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect for the formalities of ordinary juſtice; but he muſt not believe that they make up the perfection of a Chriſtian, nor of a Philoſopher. He muſt know that the Laws of Conſcience extend themſelves further then her<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>; and that they indure a ſeverer and more general obligation; In effect, if conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence onely were in the world, we ſhould be diſpenſed of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things which we are bound to do, we ſhould have probi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty good cheap; the duty of an honeſt man would be very large, and the way that leads to heaven would not be ſo long and ſtraight as the Bible deſcribes it.</p>

                  <head>The fourth Diſcourſe.</head>
                  <head type="sub">How that ſaying of the Philoſophers is to be underſtood, that, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands ought to be wiſer and better then the perſon that obeyes.</head>
                  <p>'TIs true then, that the Morall is one of the foundations whereupon the Politique is raiſed, and ought to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them that aſpire to the Government of States, and to that direction of the people. From thence is taken that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſaying of Philoſophers, <hi>That who commands ought to be better then the perſon that obeyes; and that, The Government of men belongs not to him that is a ſlave to his paſſions, nor to govern another unleſſe he hath the better ſight.</hi> It ſerves not therefore a Prince to have ordinary intelligence, or a common qualification of manners: But to ſatisfie his duty, and fill up worthily his charge, it ſeems that he ought to have a more ſublime rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and diſpoſition of will more perfect then his ſubjects; This propoſition nevertheleſs is not to be underſtood literal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and in a very rigorous ſenſe. That was good in the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of States, and in the firſt liberty which the people had to make choice of their Superiours and Maſters. Then it was neceſſary that the Election ſhould be made of extraordinary perſons, whoſe merit ought to be as high as the dignity to which they are called. But for Soveraign Princes who come by ſucceſſion, who are born with the Character of a Prince, and are received without choice; they muſt be taken as God ſends them, in wrath, or in the love he hath to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which ought to be ſubmitted unto them. But whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they are, they cannot alwayes be perfect at th'inſtant of Raigning, nor have that force of reaſon, nor temper of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners which the Philoſophers require in them that govern; Prudence, and other morall and politique vertues are not born with us, and come not of themſelves. They muſt be gained with meditation and exerciſe, and by conſequence with time and yeares. And though the principles are in our ſouls, and the ſeed in our reaſon, they remain barren till they are cultivated, and, if pains be not taken to preſerve them, they are ſmothered in the ſeeds of evill which are in our ſenſes, and in the corruption of our nature; The intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then of the Philoſophers, is, that the vertues of Princes are of more eſteem then the vertues of particular perſons, in regard that they have a greater extent of exerciſe, and a more univerſall influence; that they are more communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; that they dart their beams at greater diſtance, that their bounty attracts more imitation, and that it is not ſo eaſie to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:99746:11"/>command, as perfectly to obey; nor to lead as to follow; That if ſuch great qualities are not to be found in their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, if their birth be unhappy, and if the matter whereof they are made cannot receive ſuch divine formes, they ought at leaſt to be in them of their Council, who act with their Princes, in the conduct of Affaires.</p>
                  <p>When the Prince is ſtupid or depraved in manners; when they are contrary to the function of his charge, and to the dignity he doth exerciſe; when they move directly, and of their proper motion to the ruine of their ſubjects; What can be expected from ſuch a Government if th'infection hath alſo gained upon the Miniſters of State, if they reſemble their Maſter, if they do not counterpoiſe his vices; And if th'evill be entertained by the multitude of evill perſons, ſuch was the Councell of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> when he called to Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill onely young and deboſhed, inſtead of ancient perſons, who had been eye-witneſſes of the Government of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſaw that wiſdom acted which was infuſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the diſcourſe of Reaſon, and the cares of Experience. This nevertheleſs is not extraordinary in the world, and it happens but too often that ſuch as approach the Perſons of Princes, ſtudy not ſo much to be miniſters of their dignities, as inſtruments of their paſſions; They are rather their Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupters then Counſellors; that th'imploy Vice when Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is unprofitable to advance them, and that they eſteem nothing baſe or diſhoneſt that may ſatisfie Ambition, or aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure their fortune; And though the way they take, lead to precipices, and that there are many freſh and ſenſible exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of them who have therein ruined themſelves; that makes no impreſſion upon their minds: The ill fortune of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers concerns them not, and they have ſo good opinion of themſelves, that they imagine to have better conduct, or bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fortune to warrant their behaviour. And truly although in a ſea ſo tempeſtuous, at the Court, and where tempeſts are frequent; they ſee alſo by conſequence that ſhipwracks are ordinary there; the pieces nevertheleſſe of that wrack are ſo faire, that they ſeem to them of greater value, then the condition from whence they had been taken, and then the advantages of their birth. 'Tis true, that Corruption ſometimes is ſo extream in the ſoul of a Prince, and his Manners changed into ſo profound a deboſhery, that Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of State are compelled to abate of the ſeverity of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in treating with him; They bank thoſe paſſions which they could not ſafely aſſault in a ſtraight line; They ſuſpend the reproofe of vice, where roots were not to be ſtocked up; They practiſe diverſions, when the ſick perſon cannot
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:99746:12"/>endure Remedies, and of two Evills, in one whereof they muſt undoubtedly fall, they divert him towards the leſſer, for fear his inclination ſhould force him to the greater evill; A ſtrange unhappineſſe, that to prevent Inceſts and Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, they muſt conſent to other deboſhes leſſe criminall and leſſe injurious; and to avoid ſacriledges, to permit him to act ſingle ruines: <hi>Seneca</hi> and <hi>Burrhas</hi> found themſelves redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to this miſerable neceſſity; &amp; the Philoſophy &amp; vertue of thoſe two great perſons were conſtrained ſo to bend under <hi>Nero,</hi> &amp; to divert with induſtry the impetuoſity of his vices: which by oppoſition would have been the more enflamed. This conduct nevertheleſs which ought to be ſecret, that it may work the better effects, and be ſtolen from the eyes of the Prince, leaſt it ſhould hurt more then profit, is many times ill interpreted; and the people conſider not, that there are ſoveraign Princes who are not to be handled as men, but go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned as Lions, and as furious beaſts: and that it is a a great work to reſtrain their fury, and to hinder them from killing and devouring. Thanks be to God, we are in another condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; we have a king whoſe qualities to this time have been rather deſired then ſeen: God hath given him to the world to repair the diſorders of it; we are bound to him for our ſafety, and they that have merited in the paſt actions, were the inſtruments onely of his fortune, and the imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of his vertue. Above all, 'tis a mark of heaven's graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous aſpect upon this Prince, to have raiſed for him ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and ſo wiſe perſons, ſo underſtanding and ſo faithfull as they of his Councill. But 'tis an evidence alſo of the excellency of his Judgement, and of the ſtrength of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding to have made ſo good a choice, and to have fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his particular Election, upon his perſon who is the Chief and firſt Intelligence.</p>
                  <p>Truly, if that be true which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſayes, that he alone hath the pure uſe of Reaſon, and by conſequence the moſt perfect vertue, that hath no violent paſſions; It may be aver'd without flattery, that never perſon brought to the ſervice of Princes, and to the government of States, greater liberty of the ſoul, then Sr. the <hi>Cardinall.</hi> His condition ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empts him from the ſtrong impreſſions which blood and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſtampd upon the ſpirits of his fathers; He is a ſtranger to all thoſe inclinations, which being rooted in the body, carry away the ſoul entirely, or divide it betwixt the pleaſures of ſenſe, and the operations of the underſtanding. And as for that villanous appetite of wealth which traverſeth ſo many illuſtrious perſons; which ſubornes the moſt uſefull ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of Princes; and which hath often blotted the faireſt
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:99746:12"/>Lifes: It is farre eſtranged from his humour; 'Tis certain, that if he hath ever leaned to any extremity in the way to vertue, it hath been towards prodigality; and that he found nothing ſo eaſie as to be in danger of poverty for the ſervice of his Maſter: inſomuch that it may be ſaid of him, that he hath a ſoul ſo quiet, that not a Motion ariſeth in it, but what his duty doth ſuggeſt; not an Agitation, but what the love he bears to his King hath occaſioned; and that nothing hath been acted but what Reaſon hath conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto, and what Philoſophy hath conveyed into the ſouls of the wiſeſt perſons.</p>

                  <head type="sub">That good Miniſters of State have not alwaies the Recompence which they deſerve; and that their Services are often payed with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude.</head>
                  <p>THat a Miniſter of State propoſeth to himſelfe to act for the Love of Vertue, and to draw from himſelf the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probations of Conſcience, as the chiefeſt Recompence for the good he doth; For to hope alwayes, or for the moſt part, Acknowledgement, or Juſtice from the ſouls of Princes, is not to know their humour, and to miſtake their nature. 'Tis to be ignorant that the great ſervices which are done them, are ſo many great Crimes, when they have not wherewithall to requite them: That there are not in the world ſuch dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous debtors as Princes, when they are inſolvent; that they make away their Creditors when they cannot pay them, for the fear they have that they will pay themſelves with their hands; That they are never confident of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of their ſubjects, who have power to hurt them; and that they forgive willingly enough the offences which have been done them, but never pardon the ill which may be done, though there be no will to do it.</p>
                  <p>There are ſo many Examples of this truth, in Hiſtories and in all Ages, that 'tis almoſt a ſuperfluous thing to make ſtay upon it. But amongſt all, I ſee none comparable to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace of <hi>Belliſarius;</hi> that great perſon who had no other crime then his Reputation, and was not culpable, but that he was powerfull. Having conquered <hi>Perſia,</hi> and ſubdued <hi>Africa,</hi> humbled the <hi>Goths</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> lead Kings in Triumph, and made appeare to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> ſomewhat of old <hi>Rome,</hi> and an Idea of the ancient ſplendor of that proud Republique: After all that, I ſay, this great perſon is abandoned to Envy. A ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ill-grounded deſtroyes the value of ſo many Services,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:99746:13"/>and a ſingle jealouſie of State wipes them out of the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his Maſter: but he reſts not there, for the demeanor had been too gentle; if cruelty had not been added to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude. They deprive him of all his honours; they rob him of all his fortune: they take from him the uſe of the Day and Light: they put out his eyes, and reduce him to the company of Rogues; and <hi>Belliſarius</hi> demands a chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. I confeſſe when I conſider the chiefe Captain of his Age, and the greateſt Ornament of the Empire, of Chriſtians, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo many Victories &amp; Conqueſts, accompanied with ſo high and clear a vertue, and in the midſt of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> reduced to the height of miſery; it ſeems to me that I read the Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphoſis of Fables: A deſire poſſeſſes me to give the lie to Hiſtory; and I cannot hold from exclaiming againſt the memory of <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> that could not ſuffer the glory of one of his ſubjects, who had been ſo uſefull to him, and that of a Cabinet perſon and compiler of Lawes, had made him a Conqueror and Triumpher over people; ſo that baſneſſe coſt him vey dear, and obliged <hi>Narces</hi> who was as well a ſucceſſour in merit, as authority to <hi>Belliſarius,</hi> not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe himſelfe to the like fortune. This <hi>Narces</hi> upon a ſingle act of diſdain, which was paſt upon him at the Court of the Emperour, conceived that they might paſſe to a more cruel paſſion, if he prevented not the ill, and that it was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to ſhake off the yoak, then to ſtay to be oppreſſed. That ſpoiled th'affairs of <hi>Juſtinian</hi> in <hi>Italy:</hi> The <hi>Goths</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted, and Fortune could not forbear to be of the party which <hi>Narces</hi> followed, nor to find the <hi>Barbarians</hi> where ſo great a Virtue was engaged.</p>
                  <p>All Princes nevertheleſs are not of his humour, &amp; there are ſome whoſe Raign is more Chriſtian, and Conduct more juſt; and with whom deſert is in ſafety; where ſervices are acknowledged, and in whom brave Actions beget love, without giving them the leaſt jealouſie: However the Raign of our King is an eminent Exception to a propoſition ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall. And if <hi>Machavell</hi> had obſerved many ſuch in the world, he had not adviſed them who riſe very high by their Virtue to deſcend timely, and to quit their greatneſs, or to maintain it by force; He had known that there is yet a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium betwixt two extreams, and the King had made him ſee that his ſervants might continue great without making ill uſe of that greatneſſe to become Rebels.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Example that I will propoſe, is the diſgrace of <hi>Ferrand Gonſalve;</hi> 'Tis not in truth accompanied with ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent a perſecution, nor with ſuch cruell marks of Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and Injuſtice, as that of <hi>Belliſarius:</hi> But it hath neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:99746:13"/>circumſtances which deſerve to be conſidered, and whereupon a Miniſter of State ought to pauſe. It muſt be confeſſed that <hi>Gonſalve</hi> is the greateſt perſon that ever <hi>Spain</hi> brought forth. He may paſſe among the greateſt of all Ages: He was worthy to enter the Liſts of compariſon with great <hi>Scipio;</hi> and the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> vanity hath not invented ſo high a Title to honour him withall, which he hath not made good by his Actions, and merited of his Enemies. He finiſhed the conqueſt of the Kingdom of <hi>Granada,</hi> and had the honour to conclude a War of ten years, and to gain for <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Iſabella,</hi> the Sirname of Catholiques. He chaſed us from the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> for to re-eſtabliſh the <hi>Arragons;</hi> And when <hi>Ferdinand</hi> ſhared with <hi>Lewis</hi> the twelfth, the Goods of his Parents, and that thoſe Princes divided betwixt them the Inheritance of an unfortunate perſon; He conquered his Maſter's ſhare and forced ours from us: He defeated our Armies in all places, but at <hi>Seminara</hi> where he did not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; He took all the Towns he aſſaulted, and which were defended by us: He knew how to overcome, and to make uſe of the Victory. And though no State in the World was more moveable or ſubject to Revolutions then that of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples;</hi> He aſſured it notwithſtanding entirely to <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and his Race. He ſtopped up there the Springs of the War, and of Diſorders: He pulled up Factions that tore the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in pieces; and, if ſome root had ſince appeared, it had ſo little life and force, and ſuch weak and faint motions, that the ſafety of the Kingdome was not ſhaken, nor its health altered.</p>
                  <p>He did not onely excell in War, and exceed all Captains of his time in the glory of Armes; but he ſupreamly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the Art of Negotiations, and the knowledge of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs. His Eloquence was admirable; His ſpeech had inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table charms, and his Tongue furniſht infallibly to gain thoſe whom his good Countenance had ſhaken, and whoſe liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was weakened, and courage abated; Being a Priſoner to a King of <hi>Granada,</hi> He gained him to the ſervice of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and perſwaded him to given himſelfe up to <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> who would have had much trouble to overcome him: He withdrew the <hi>Colonnes</hi> and the <hi>Urſines</hi> from th'intereſt of <hi>France,</hi> for to caſt them upon th'intereſt of <hi>Spain:</hi> And know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well that long and inveterate hatreds as they were of both Families, are fatall to the parties where they enter, and dangerous in the occaſions that awaken them. He reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the differences, and for a time healed th'Emulation they laboured of. He was moreover ſo zealous of the Greatneſſe of his Maſter, and ſo paſſionate for the good of his Affaires,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:99746:14"/>that he quitted his Conſcience, and broke his faith to whom he had given it: As in the Treaty he made with the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Calabria,</hi> whereof I ſhall ſpeak in another place, and when he ſeized with ſubtilty upon the perſon of <hi>Caeſar Borgia,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that ſubtil perſon, who had deceived ſo many other perſons.</p>
                  <p>Th'incomparable qualites then of this perſon, and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite ſervices which he had done to his Maſter, rendred him a ſuſpected perſon. And though they love treaſon, yet they hate the Traytors: on the contrary, the Virtue of <hi>Gonſalve</hi> gives Apprehenſions and Alarms to <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> for whom it had gained Kingdoms, And the conqueſts alſo of <hi>Naples,</hi> and th'entire reduction of that of that State being finiſhed: He began more willingly than he ſhould have done, to lend his Ear to the complaints made againſt him; And the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny became inſolent, to aſſault him when it received cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit from his Maſter. 'Tis impoſſible that they who have Commiſſions for great Commands, ſhould give content to all the world: And 'tis hard to give imployments to all ſuch as believe to merit them, or recompences to the eſteem that every Perſon hath of his ſervices, and to the value he ſets upon them; and therefore there are alwaies perſons that do complain, becauſe ſome do believe themſelves ill uſed; and who make ſpight and hatred to ſucceed at the rate of the good they have been diſappointed of: This un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſſe befell the great Captain; And it happened alſo that the complaints made againſt him in <hi>Spain,</hi> were not diſagreeable to <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> who ſought occaſion onely to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy him, and did not act an Injuſtice willingly, but when he had ſome pretence of Juſtice for to colour it: 'Tis ſtrange, what torments and inquietudes the reputation of <hi>Gonſalve</hi> gave to <hi>Ferdinand</hi> all the reſt of his life; The moſt loyal and beſt diſpoſed of all his Subjects; He to whom he owed a part of his Greatneſſe, who rendred him more formidable to other Princes, then all the reſt of his powers, held his ſoul on a perpetuall wrack: And he never had any Enemy from whom he ſuffered ſo much and ſo long as from him. He was almoſt perſwaded to extream Remedies to be rid of him, and, if he had not apprehended that in miſſing of his ſtroak, he gave him occaſion to become a Rebell, he had cauſed him to be arreſted upon the ſingle Motions of Jealouſie, and had given an inſtance of the force of the greateſt of all humane paſſions, which is the love of Soveraignty.</p>
                  <p>This paſſion which ſo much vexed <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> is worthy to be repreſented: and th'Artifices uſed by the greateſt Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titian of the world, to ruine his own ſubject, are too ſubtill,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:99746:14"/>and too curious to be concealed from a perſon of State; The moderation alſo of <hi>Gonſalve,</hi> and the ſtrength he had to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt his own Greatneſſe which was in his power, and to repel a temptation which had a Kingdom for prize, deſerve to be propoſed to the ſubjects of other Princes.</p>

                     <hi>FErdinand</hi> then upon the bare complaints of diſcontented perſons, whereof the number is ever great againſt them that govern, leſſeneth the power of the great Captain, and reduceth him to the ordinary Authority of Vice-Kings in a Kingdome which he had conquered. How ſenſible this thing was to a perſon of great courage, and what <hi>Emotion</hi> it ought to raiſe in the heart of <hi>Gonſalve,</hi> may be judged by the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure all men have to fall, and to be degraded in th'eyes of the world; And it may be judged by the hatred all men naturally bear to ingratitude, but they onely that exerciſe it; and by th'injuſtice it contains; that not onely the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices that have been rendred, ſhall be fruſtrated of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward which hath been merited, but that they alſo ſhall be th'originall of the diſgraces ſuffered, and of th'ill entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, becauſe a ſufficient Recompence cannot be received. <hi>Gonſalve</hi> notwithſtanding ſubdued his reſentments, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared much greater in conquering himſelfe in ſo tickliſh an occaſion, then he had done in conquering ſo often th'en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emies of his Maſter.</p>
                  <p>The patience wherewith he ſupported this injury, did not ſweeten <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> nor cure his ſick ſpirit. On the contrary it made it irreconcilable: He hates him the more whom he had newly offended, becauſe he gave him cauſe to reſent it, and takes the moderation which <hi>Gonſalve</hi> uſed for an Artifice, becauſe his paſſion would not ſuffer him to attribute it to the greatneſs of his Courage; That made him reſolve to bring him back from <hi>Naples,</hi> though his preſence there way yet ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry neceſſary, and to deliver himſelfe at once of all his feares, and of all his apprehenſions, in removing him from that place where he was ſo powerfull. He commands him then to return into <hi>Spain,</hi> ſince th'affaires of <hi>Naples,</hi> as he ſaid, were in good condition, and informs him that he had uſe in other places of his perſon, and of his ſervice. The great Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain prepares for his departure, but not with that nimble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which <hi>Ferdinand</hi> deſired; To whoſe inquietude preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitation would have appeared ſlow, ſince it ſeemed to him
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:99746:15"/>that he could never be ſoon enough healed of the diſtruſt which did torment him; This ſlowneſs which was for his ſervice, and for the confirming of <hi>Ferdinand's</hi> authority in the Kingdom which <hi>Gonſalve</hi> would not leave tottering, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth his feares and multiplies his jealouſies.</p>
                  <p>Th'Enemies of <hi>Gonſalve</hi> cloſe with this humour in <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand;</hi> Envy again riſeth againſt his Virtue, and there were but too many perſons in <hi>Spain,</hi> and in <hi>Italy,</hi> who cryed down his Faithfulneſſe, and repreſented his Ambition to ſuch a height, that it would not fail ſpeedily to compell him to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the Pitle of Soveraign, whereof he exerciſed the Power.</p>
                  <p>That made him again reſolve to ſend <hi>Peter Navarre</hi> to <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> with private Orders to ceaze upon the perſon of the great Captain, and to make a Priſoner of him in the new Caſtle. And at the ſame time to lay him aſleep, and for fear the diſtruſt he had of him, ſhould occaſion the injury he feared, if it were diſcovered; he writes him a Letter, by which he doth promiſe him at his return, the great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of <hi>Saint James;</hi> A dignity, that did not truly equall the ſervices of <hi>Gonſalve,</hi> nor pay the juſt price of his Actions, but was the higheſt in <hi>Spain</hi> next to the Soveraignty. As he was ready to execute this ſcandalous reſolution, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Credit arrives at Court, from the great Captain, with Letters, which give him ſo great aſſurances of his fidelity, and confirm with ſuch ſtrong Reaſons the juſt cauſe of his ſtay, that <hi>Ferdinand</hi> abated for that time the violence that tranſported him; but at laſt finding no lawfull Cauſes, or very viſible pretences to uſe extream Remedies againſt <hi>Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalve,</hi> and being not aſſured of the poſſeſſion of <hi>Naples,</hi> ſo long as <hi>Gonſalve</hi> was in condition to take it from him, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to go in perſon to draw him away.</p>
                  <p>He was hardly arrived at <hi>Genes,</hi> but he underſtood of the death of his Son in law, with whom he had ſo many trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and who had handled him with ſo much indignity. Reaſon ſeemed to adviſe him to go back, and to retake the poſſeſſion of the Government of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> before any change might happen there, that th'ill humours of that State were raiſed, and that th'ill had taken root there by his abſence. That was repreſented to him by his Councill, and by his ſervants which he had left in <hi>Spain.</hi> But <hi>Naples</hi> muſt be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for, ſince he was ſo near; He muſt pull the Thorn out of his heart which pricked him; And although he would not expoſe his perſon thither, when we were powerful there, when we conteſted the Kingdom with him, and that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune then held in the Air the two ſcales of the Ballance
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:99746:15"/>where Victory hung uncertain; He made no queſtion to go thither to deſtroy the power of a perſon that was moſt faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to him. The prudence and dexterity of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> made a wonderfull noyſe on this occaſion which was heard in all places, and whereon all Chriſtendom was attentive. At his Arrivall he made extraordinary Careſſes to <hi>Gonſalve:</hi> He gave him honours that would have ſatisfied the moſt ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious ſpirit of the world. He had no ſufficient praiſes to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toll his vertue, nor power enough to requite his ſervices. In brief, one might have ſaid, that, he would give him a ſhare of his Authority, and of his ſubject make his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time this great Captain is ſolicited from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers places, to take more advantageous Conditions then he had from his Maſter. The Pope with whom <hi>Ferdinand</hi> had founded intelligencies to make War againſt the <hi>Venetians,</hi> deſires him for the Generall of the Churches Armies.</p>
                  <p>The Common wealth of <hi>Venice</hi> offers him the Command of their Armies; The Emperour endeavours to gain him for his ſervice; every perſon thought that Victory could not be ſevered from him, and his reputation diſpatched above th'halfe of Affairs; His virtue truly was too fair not be tempted; But it had force enough to repell Temptation, and to reſiſt the Baits wherewith Endeavours were uſed to corrupt it; He had given infallible Evidences thereof to <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand</hi> during the perſecution of <hi>Caſtile:</hi> And when almoſt all the Grandees of <hi>Spain</hi> had declared themſelves in favour of his Son in law, and adored that new Power; <hi>Gonſalve</hi> ſtood firm, and aſſured him that what change ſoever hapned to him in his fortune, none ſhould ever befall him in his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; This was truly admirable in an occaſion, where he had ſo many examples of failing, and, it may be, ſome Cauſe to do it during <hi>Philips</hi> life. Moreover being ſo able a perſon, and having long acted by th'orders of <hi>Ferdinand;</hi> It, was not poſſible that he ſhould be a ſtranger to his diffident Humour, and to his Covetous Inclination, and therefore ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that his ſervices would paſs unrequited, and that paſſion whereof his Maſter laboured againſt, would not be appeaſed but by his Fall and Ruine. However <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> to defeat th'intentions of the Pope, and to make void all ſolicitations that were made to <hi>Gonſalve;</hi> endeavoured to perſwade him, that he had all the good opinion of the world of his fidelity; gives him a Patent of the great Maſter ſhip of <hi>Saint James,</hi> which was paſſionately deſired by <hi>Gonſalve,</hi> and prayed the Pope to grant the Archbiſhop of <hi>Toledo</hi> power to confer it upon him; He well knew that the Pope would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:99746:16"/>it, and be troubled that <hi>Gonſalve</hi> ſhould receive that dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity from any hand but from His, and that ſo whilſt, Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours were uſed to overcome that difficulty and paſs that Ditch, he ſhould be in <hi>Spain,</hi> and out of Danger to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boſhed; He grants him after that an Authentick Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the great ſervices he had received from him; at of the eſteem he had for his merits, and for the inviolable zeal he had had for his Affairs. He ſends this Declaration to the Courts of all Princes of Chriſtendom, to efface, ſaid He, th'Impreſſions that might have been made againſt the faithfulneſſe of this great Captain; and that no ſpot might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main upon the honour of ſo great a perſon, He draws him from <hi>Italy,</hi> and brings him with him, by theſe eminent Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices and Pompous Demonſtrations of his good Affections. The interview made at <hi>Savona</hi> with <hi>Lewis</hi> the twelfth, enfla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med his jealouſie, and rendred the Virtue of <hi>Gonſalve</hi> the more ſuſpected, becauſe he ſaw it ſo much honoured by him, to whom he had done ſo much Evill, and from whom he had taken a Kingdom; For <hi>Lewis</hi> obtained of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> that <hi>Gonſalve</hi> might dine in their company, an extraordinary fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, eſpecially for a ſubject of <hi>Spain</hi> with his <hi>Soveraign.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At laſt he is conducted into <hi>Spain,</hi> where all the hopes which had been given him, and the magnificent promiſes wherewith he had been fed, are reduced to the Condition of a private perſon, in which Condition he is permitted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more then onely to live. They labour to diſcredit him, They uſe him ill in relation to his Parents: All his deſires are refuſed, though very Civill and Juſt: And notwithſtanding this ſtripped perſon is <hi>Ferdinand's</hi> Flayl, and a virtue deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of all the helps of fortune, troubles his ſpirit, and puts him into great paines. But as Princes feel not paſſions as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſons do, and take or leave them according to their Intereſt; The proſperity of <hi>Lewis</hi> the twelfth's Armes in <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> under the Command of <hi>Gaſton</hi> of <hi>Foix,</hi> and the diſgraces of th'Army, of the League whereof <hi>Ferdinand</hi> was a member, enforced him to caſt his eyes upon <hi>Gonſalve</hi> to ſend him thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>This great Captain prepares for this Expedition; <hi>Spain</hi> diſ-furniſheth her ſelfe of brave perſons for to follow him there; and the greateſt part of great perſons, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fierceneſſe of their humour, and good opinion of themſelves, reſolved to accompany him thither. This ſtruck <hi>Ferdinand</hi> more then can be imagined; And the greatneſſe of <hi>Gonſalve</hi> that became higher then ever; and th'ill condition of th'affairs of <hi>Italy</hi> which could not be recovered but by his virtue, trouble him with irreſolutions. But fortune that
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:99746:16"/>had been ſo often favourable vnto him, forgot him not in this occaſion; ſhe would not give men the pleaſure to ſee the two chief planets of the world in Conjunction, and dueſt not decide a difference where parties were ſo equall. <hi>Gaſton</hi> is ſlain at the Batted of <hi>Ravenna;</hi> by his death <hi>Italy</hi> changed her face, our affaires began then to decline; There was no further need of <hi>Gonſalve,</hi> and <hi>Ferdinand</hi> was delivered of the feares which had ſo ſtrongly vexed him, and ſo long purſued him. The great Captain after that continued intirely eſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from Court, and from affairs, and a very little after quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the world, where his virtue was become unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, becauſe it was too great, and where he had loſt the good graces of his Maſter for having overmuch merited them.</p>

                  <p>SInce we are upon the ſubject of Diſgraces which happen at Court, and tempeſts which are there raiſed; Let us add the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Alva</hi>'s to the former examples. He was one of the greateſt Captains <hi>Spain</hi> hath brought forth, ſince the death of <hi>Gonſalve;</hi> He performed threeſcores years ſervices to <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, and to <hi>Philip</hi> his Son, and with ſo ſtrange a misfortune, that he was ever odious to th'one, and never beloved of th'other: He made War almoſt in all the parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> and in <hi>Africa;</hi> he had the Command of the <hi>Germane</hi> Army, where the firſt League of Proteſtants was beaten, and one of their Commanders taken Priſoner: He preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> to <hi>Philip:</hi> He ſtaid the progreſs we made into <hi>Piedmont;</hi> He ſuppreſſed the growing Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion in the Low Countries; and though his conduct was too violent, and that the ſeverity of his deportment, and too great Inclination for blood, had forced the people into diſpair; yet if he had not been recalled, when he was of moſt uſe there, 'Tis believed, that he had finiſhed the reduce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them, or hindered them from growing greater.</p>
                  <p>And nevertheleſſe after ſo long Courſe of ſervices, and ſo many years ſpent for his Maſters; <hi>Philip</hi> forbids him the Court for a light fault; for an inconſiderable Cauſe which carried onely the ſhadow of diſobedience: His Country-houſe he aſſigns him for his Priſon, and neither his ſervices paſt, nor his Age which was worthy of ſome reſpect, nor the good wiſhes of all the people of <hi>Spain,</hi> nor th'entreaties of the <hi>Pope</hi> who interceded for him, could bend <hi>Philip,</hi> or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with him for his Liberty. But at laſt the buſineſſe of the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:99746:17"/>ſucceſſion of <hi>Portugal</hi> hapning, and <hi>Philip</hi> having need of a Commander of Reputation to manage the War which he had there prepared; It was of Neceſſity to repair to the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Alva.</hi> He accepted the Command with an incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Gentleneſs, and without obtaining ſo much as the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to ſee the Court; And He was to raiſe the Regiments of Foot, as He ſaid, from Towns to conquer Kingdoms. The ſucceſs of that War was ſuch as <hi>Philip</hi> could deſire it. But the Concluſion was glorious for the <hi>Duke,</hi> ſince he dyed after the reduction of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and in the Palace of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> where he had given Entry to his Maſter.</p>
                  <p>I do not truly find it ſtrange that ſo many Princes are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankful, becauſe it may be they think all to be due to them, and that they are not indebted to any perſon. But I cannot but admire the faithfulneſſe of thoſe great perſons of whom I have lately ſpoken, and that Generall obedience they have given to their Maſters, even then when they were ſo ill u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; This is the Cauſe that I will adde another example to the former, and of a perſon of the number of the moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous of the Age paſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Albuquerque</hi> ſubdued <hi>Ormus,</hi> took <hi>Goa,</hi> and ſettled th'Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of the <hi>Portugals</hi> in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies.</hi> He cauſed the power of his Maſters to be adored, where their name was not ſo much as known before his time. His Conqueſts enriched <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal,</hi> and the precious Jewels which the Sun-riſing engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in th'Eaſt, paſt in abundance, ſince his voyages, through all <hi>Europe.</hi> After all theſe ſervices, and in his great Age, <hi>Manuel,</hi> King, of <hi>Portugal,</hi> ſends him a ſucceſſor, and he had the diſpleaſure to ſee himſelf ſtript of an honour he had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and of a Dignity he held not of the bounty of him which took it from him, but from his perſonall valour. The news truly of that Affront which was the recompence of his long and profitable ſervices, troubled him much at the firſt—And, making a great diſturbance in his ſoul, forced him to ſay theſe words: <hi>Good God, of how many Evills do I find my ſelfe encompaſſed! If I am faithful to my King, I offend men; and I offend my King, if I follow the Inclinations of men.</hi> But this violent paſſion being appeaſed, and that his reaſon was returned, he juſtified the proceedings of <hi>Manuel,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced willingly to the condition of a private perſon; If Death, which ſometimes happens too late to many great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, had not ceazed on him, before he arrived at <hi>Goa</hi> from <hi>Ormus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You may believe that <hi>Albuquerque</hi> was ſolicited by his friends, to poſſeſs himſelfe of that State, and to eſtabliſh himſelfe in a place where he was powerful, and where he had
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:99746:17"/>in his favour the love of the people; 'Tis therefore the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of Princes, not to permit long the Government of a Country to him that hath ſubdued it, for fear leſt in time he take root there, and that the ſweetneſſe of the Command, and the Conveniency of making himſelfe Maſter, ſhould cauſe in him the Deſire of it. So <hi>Ferdinand</hi> of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> left not the Government of the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> to <hi>Chriſtopher Columbe,</hi> who had made the diſcovery of them. So the ſame <hi>Prince</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew that great Captain from <hi>Naples,</hi> as hath been above expreſſed. So <hi>Fernant</hi> of <hi>Cortes</hi> was recalled from the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Mexico,</hi> which he had gained for <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth; So the <hi>Peru</hi> was filled with Combuſtion and Wars, becauſe the <hi>Pizarres</hi> who had made the Conqueſt, would not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Governour which <hi>Philip</hi> the ſecond had ſent thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; nor obey in the place where they had accuſtomed to command.</p>

                  <p>In the league made between the <hi>Venetians</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, againſt <hi>Soliman,</hi> a memorable accident happened. The <hi>Venetians</hi> were fully reſolved not to break with <hi>Soliman,</hi> and to avoid a War wherein they were to receive the firſt ſtroaks, and furniſh the Field with th'action that was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring, (and the theater with the Tragedy; They remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, that they never had to do with the houſe of the <hi>Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> without loſſe, and that they never juſtled with them but to their ruine: They would not forſake th'Alliance of a Prince whoſe faith was known to them, in whom ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on permitted Juſtice, and was accuſtomed to diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween what's honeſt, and what is onely profitable; They would not deprive themſelves of the great advantages which they drew from thoſe States, nor cut the pipe of Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and the root of Abundance, which came to their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects from thence; They were not ignorant of the Nature of Leagues and their weakneſs; They, knew that good deeds penetrate leſſe then injuries, and that the deſire of Revenge is more active and violent in them that are provoked, then Acknowledgement in them who are aſſiſted. They conſider that a wiſe Prince ought not to engage, but on extremity in th'affaires that have nothing certain but the expence, whereof the future is alwaies trouble, and whoſe concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not neceſſarily conformable to Principles, and to the firſt Appearance.</p>
                  <p>Upon theſe foundations or others, they reſiſted th'endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of <hi>Paul</hi> the third, who ſolicited them to enter into that League, and not to abandon the common Cauſe of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; <hi>Soliman</hi> alſo on his part deſired to continue fair with the Republique of <hi>Venice:</hi> He was afraid to have ſo many enemies together in Hand, and how great ſoever their ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was, the virtue and the power of <hi>Charles</hi> did not ſeem ſo inconſiderable unto him, but that he judged them Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable alone to exerciſe him; But as fortune often deceives the deſires of men, and laughs at their wiſdom, it diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in this occaſion, as well th'inclination of <hi>Soliman,</hi> as that of the <hi>Venetians.</hi> The encounter of ſome of their Ships,

For it happened that the Gallies of th'Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour having not done their duty at <hi>Preveſe,</hi> and <hi>André Dona</hi> having betrayed the Chriſtian Republique, and ſuffered <hi>Barbaroſſe</hi> to eſcape when he might have ſunk him; The tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt that riſ' in the States of <hi>Charles,</hi> fell upon them of the Republique; and <hi>Soliman,</hi> offended that the Republique, as he thought, had diſdained his friendſhip, or had not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently reſpected it, turned his Forces and Deſigns againſt their Ilands, beſieged <hi>Corfu,</hi> and was within little of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Bulwarks that defend Chriſtendom; He took be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that, all that they had in the Archipelagus except <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> of <hi>Romaigna</hi> and <hi>Malvoiſca,</hi> which he forced from them ſince, by a Treaty of peace; after the loſſes they had ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, after th'Expence they had made, and after a great dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution of former Reputation.</p>
                  <p>Behold other Examples, to ſhew that there are faults which ſeem fatall. In the firſt troubles of Hereſie in <hi>France,</hi> and in that Tragique Confuſion, the memory whereof hath ſince been often repeated; All the world obſerved, that the ſiege of <hi>Poictiers</hi> had been the Stone of offence to the <hi>Huguenots,</hi> and that the faireſt Army they ever had periſhed, there. The <hi>Cardinall</hi> of <hi>Lorraine</hi> reproached it to <hi>Sr.</hi> of the <hi>None;</hi> and though faults are cuſtomary in the war, more then in any other function of life; He aſſured him that they who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded th'Armies of the King, would prevent committing of the like; yet notwithſtanding after the Battel of <hi>Moncontour,</hi> which poured out ſo much <hi>Hugenots</hi> blood, and where that party received ſuch large wounds, that it depended on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the Conqueror, that the ſoul was not let out; Inſtead of following the flight of th'Army which was routed, and them that ſaved themſelves from the ſtorm; The <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Anjou,</hi> unhappily diſſipated his Army by lying down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Saint John.</hi> He ſtormed that Town, and loſt the fruit of his Victory, which ought not to have been taken of a ſingle place, but the Reducement of the whole party; not the remiſſion of the Malady, but the health of the State. By this fatall ſtay, I ſay, he failed to make an end of the work that was ſo well begun: He gave meanes to th'Enemies to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:99746:19"/>breathe and recruit: He rendred again the fortune of <hi>France</hi> doubtfull, and deprived it of the honour of terminating a War which is never ended by weakneſſe, but inability; nor by Reconciliation, but by the Ruine of the Conquered.</p>

                  <head>The Ninth Diſcourſe.</head>
                  <head type="sub">Where the precedent Diſcourſe is confirmed by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>I Will confirm former Diſcourſe by a newer Example, and from the moſt prudent Nation of the world. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> who have their Reaſon ſo ſubtil, and Motions ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular; who make no Conſultations, but they obſerve all the differences of the time, and have alwaies in their thoughts the future and the paſt, when they deliberate onely of the things in hand, or that are not farre from their eyes. Theſe prudent, I ſay, and Circumſpect perſons, are not free from errours; They commit faults like other men, they go out of the way as well as we, and more is not to be ſaid, then that it ſeems their failings are either voluntary or more inavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble then ours; And as we fall ordinarily as it were by night and in unknown wayes, They fall at full noon, and in the midſt of a high way. And as other people have reproached us, that we are capable to Conquer all, and to carry by aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault what makes reſiſtance; But that we are not able long to preſerve that heat, nor to maintain our Conqueſts: The ſame may be ſaid of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> that their deſigns have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times good beginnings, which attain not alwaies their Ends becauſe they are Immoderate; That they begin well, but finiſh not alwaies the work they undertake, becauſe they withdraw themſelves to other work; that they make not an end of all things they undertake, in regard that they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake too much at a time, that they Graſp more then they know how to hold and devour, more then they can di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt.</p>
                  <p>'Tis not for want of patience, but for their too great Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition; nor, that they forſake the Labour for being a weary and to reſt themſelves, but they ſuſpend it, or ſlack it in one place to attend it in another, where they think to proſper better: And as the Covetous perſon hath no ſooner the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire in his heart of being rich, but he deſires ſuddenly to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come rich; The like is the condition of the ambitious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, there are no degrees for the growth of paſſion, 'tis great as ſoon as 'tis born, and he hath th'unhappineſſe, that his Imagination knows not how to bound the Conqueſts which
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:99746:19"/>it meditates upon, nor lengthen the time, muſt neceſſarily be imployed to act them. This hath happened to the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards;</hi> It may be ſaid, that they have found their enterpriſes more difficult then they were repreſented unto them, in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving too great an opinion of their own virtue, or too little of other mens virtues. Lets come to the proof of this truth wherewith they have furniſhed us, and whereof they have given us cauſe to beware.</p>
                  <p>They obſerved that th'Enterpriſe upon <hi>England,</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for that Fleet which they called <hi>Invincible,</hi> broke the courſe of the Victories of the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Parma;</hi> that it dray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Spain</hi> of Money and Men, and hindred that Prince from receiving neceſſary recruits to continue the War. They alſo acknowledged, that the journies he made into <hi>France,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the League, had unfurniſhed the two Countries of their beſt Souldiers, and left thoſe fair. Provinces for a prey to their Enemies which had been ſo long their <hi>Indyes,</hi> and ſince have been ſo long their Poverty and Church-yard.</p>
                  <p>We may indeed ſay here, by the way, and then we will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to our ſubject; That <hi>Philip</hi> the ſecond did not a little forget himſelfe in theſe occaſions, and that his Conduct was then too wiſe, or not wiſe enough. That it was not truly ill argued for the ſubduing of the <hi>Hollande's,</hi> firſt to ceaze on <hi>France,</hi> and Conquer <hi>England;</hi> to cut off at once th'Armes that ſupported them, and force away the Dugs which fed the Rebellion of that people. But alſo, that it was too vaſt a Deſign for a <hi>Prince</hi> ſo decayed, and a way too long and too dangerous for a perſon of ſo ſmall ſtrength, and ſhort breath; That if he was tranſported by the zeal of th'houſe of God, and could not ſuffer Religion to periſh in the firſt Kingdom of the world: If he was concerned in th'ill of <hi>France;</hi> and if he ſo vehemently loved the Church, that he could not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſo faire a member to be ſeparated from her; It muſt be confeſſed, that his zeal had been commendable, if it had been more prudent. But he ſhould have remembred that true Charity excludes not Juſtice; that it perverts not th'order of things; that it diſorders not the duty of life; and that it hath as much light as heat, and of moderation as force: And therfore that it had been better to withdraw the people from Hereſie which God ſubmitted to him, and from rebellion wherein they were involved, then to ingage in th'affaires of his Neighbours, whereof he was not to give an Accompt, and that he was more obliged to labour the Cure of his ſick ſubjects, then the leſſer diſeaſes of ſtrangers. But lets ſpeak the truth, It troubled <hi>Philip</hi> much to loſe ſo fair an occaſion as that which then preſented it ſelfe, to gain by our diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:99746:20"/>And he well ſaw that after the <hi>French</hi> were divided into Factions, and that the Children had torn in pieces their Mother, it would be eaſie for him to recollect the ſcattered members and the pieces of th'Inheritance. That if the loſt this Conjuncture, he might after in vain deſire it; that the madmen might return to their ſenſes, and that they had been corrupted by Charmes and Drenches; That they being cured might change their love into hatred, and be animated againſt them who had put them into that Condition.</p>
                  <p>Though the <hi>Spaniards</hi> made the forementioned reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they failed not to ſtrike upon the ſame ſands, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat their faults. Th'Emperour had incredible ſucceſs in <hi>Germany;</hi> His Conqueſts forced in upon him like a Torrent; God ſent him Victories like thoſe of the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when they marched under the Conduct of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Joſhua,</hi> and it was no more a <hi>Caeſar</hi> by name, and the vain Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what he ought to be, but he had the power and the majeſty. His Authority gave reputation to the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> His Armies rendred them more fearfull than they were, and they ſaw their deſires crowned with the taking of <hi>Breda,</hi> which <hi>Spinola</hi> boaſted to have taken in ſpight of four Kings, and th'ayds of divers Nations in League: After that nothing was thought impoſſible for them. And notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding inſtead of purſuing the great progreſs which they had made in the Low-Countties, and to follow their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune which marched before them; they provoked troubles in <hi>Italy,</hi> and ſharpned the ſpirits of divers Princes, in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing themſelves of the <hi>Valtoline.</hi> The uſurpation of that paſſage gave occaſion to make a league for to make it free, and the War was carryed into <hi>Piedmont,</hi> whither they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed great forces, which ſerved onely to make th'affront more eminent, which they received before <hi>Verrne,</hi> and to augment the ſhame of that retreat.</p>
                  <p>But they fell not alone into the precipices: They drew in the Emperour, whoſe name they made uſe of to vex <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur</hi> of <hi>Mantouë.</hi> To put I ſay, a poor Catholique Prince into his ſhirt who reverenced him; they compelled him to agree with the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and to make a diſhonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able peace with the Proteſtant Enemy. They conſtrained him to take the Law of the Conquered; to reſtore him his Loſſes, and to let looſe the Chain which preſſed all <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many.</hi> There's apparance, that if he had continued the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns he had in that Country, and thoſe in <hi>Flanders;</hi> They had compleated His Happineſs; At leaſt they had avoided the diſgraces which happened unto them; they had given no ſcandall to <hi>Chriſtendom. Boldne</hi> had been preſerved, and ſo
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:99746:20"/>Catholique a City had not entertained Hereſie within its walls, nor lamented the loſſe of th'ancient Religion. But in this they had not onely men for Enemies, but God ſeemed to declare, and to make War againſt them; And as he ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed heretofore the <hi>Philiſtins</hi> to take th' <hi>Ark</hi> of the Covenant, and with it the fortune of th'houſe of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> He hath alſo permitted that the wealth of the new world ſhould paſs into other hands then theirs: That their Fleet ſhould be beaten, and that Heretiques whom they name Rebels, made uſe of the treaſures againſt them, which were deſtined for th'op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of a Prince whom they took for their Enemy, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that he was not their ſubject, or ought not to be their Neighbour without depending on them. Yet, praiſed be God, we have been wiſer; for what the King had underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, his Conſtancy was never tyred, and He Acted not by halfs, nor laboured without Effect; no irregular paſſion could make diverſion upon his deſignes: He finiſhed all of them; He hath diſſipated all th'ill humours of the State; He hath confounded the Rebellion of his ſubjects, and our Allies have ſeen all the powers of <hi>France</hi> diſplayed, and all the vertue of the <hi>French,</hi> to maſter their ill fortune, and draw them from the bottom of the pit. In that miraculous paſſage over the <hi>Alpes,</hi> when <hi>Italy</hi> ſaw her deliverer to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend; and that <hi>Milan</hi> durſt take ſome free breath; and <hi>Naples</hi> think of a gentler Domination, who would not have believed that the King would have purſued his Victory, and taken in <hi>Italy</hi> a Revenge of the loſſes of his Aunceſtors? And nevertheleſſe by a Councell that was underſtood a few perſons, and by an extraordinary prudence, he quirted the deceitfull appearance of good; He retired from <hi>Italy,</hi> and contented himſelfe for that time to ſtench the blood of it, and bind up the wound, for to finiſh in Langnedock the Cure of an Evill that was in its Criſis, and which a greater ſtay might have made incureable; But of that we will make, God aiding, hereafter a diſcourſe apart,</p>

                  <p>LEt a Miniſter of State know that he doth alwaies ill, when he acts againſt th'orders are given him. That in the State, good intentions are not warrantable if th'effects are not agreeable to the <hi>Prince:</hi> That the works of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erogation are not current there, and that the ſervices that are
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:99746:21"/>rendred, if they are not commanded, are things put to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, which are expoſed to the capricious humour of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon interreſſed, and ſhall ſometimes be condemned by him, who would be ſorry if they were not done, who drawes profit from them, and hereby accommodates his affairs; ſo true it is, that reaſon of State is a ſtrange thing, and that the Condition of men, and chiefly of publique perſons is unhappy; Th'Examples will declare better then diſcourſe which is to be obſerved in this matter.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> puniſhed with death the Captains that had gained a battel without advice, and againſt the rules of War; nothing is read anſwerable to the jealouſie the firſt <hi>Romans</hi> had for Command. They could not give a good countenance to the ſucceſſes which were obtained with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience. And there were Fathers, who would not give life their Children, that were victorious in Combats that had been forbidden them. At the ſiege of <hi>Cambrey,</hi> or of <hi>Dour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lans,</hi> the Count <hi>Fuentes</hi> cauſed the head of a maſter of the Camp to be cut off, who in an aſſault advanced further then he was commanded, and took a poſt of very great Importance. And though the profits of theſe happy faults, and of thoſe blind ſucceſſes, remain to the Prince and Country; 'Tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, there's cauſe for their puniſhment to hinder th'imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which is often dangerous; And for th'Evill is in it, that the Judgement of a ſuperiour ſhould be ſleighted by a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſon, and his Authority violated: Amongſt us, theſe Attempts are praiſed when they proſper, and they are not puniſhed when they are unfortunate. But it is a condition inſeparable from our humour, and an effect of that blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which poſſeſſeth almoſt all <hi>France,</hi> To neglect prudence and Order, and to have an eſteem onely for Impetuoſities, and to Idolize nothing but Courage.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve an Example very remarkable in our time, and a fault of another nature, then the prudence and love of the Country would have adviſed, and the <hi>Prince</hi> to whom it was of Advantage, judged it worthy of puniſhment. At the peace which was made 1617, by the Mediation of the King, betwixt the Republique of <hi>Venice,</hi> and the <hi>Arch-Duke Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand,</hi> who is now Emperour; The King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Savoy.</hi> The Republique of <hi>Venice</hi> employed <hi>Octavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Buon</hi> as their extraordinary Embaſſador, a Gentleman of great opinion among the <hi>Citizens,</hi> to manage that affair with the <hi>Guſſony,</hi> their ordinary Embaſſadour near the King. The Inſtruments given to their Embaſſadours, commanded them not to conſent to any Treaty of peace, but on condition the <hi>Galleres,</hi> which had been taken from the <hi>Venetians</hi> at <hi>Spalatre,</hi>
                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:99746:21"/>by the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Oſſone</hi> ſhould be reſtored, and that that blot was taken out from th'honour of the Republique: They had alſo Orders, though not ſo formall and expreſs, to oppoſe th'union that was in forming between the two Crowns, to give joyntly the Law to <hi>Italy,</hi> and to the reſt of <hi>Europe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſſe the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who ſayl with all winds, and raiſe profit out of all occaſions, put a great value upon th'Evidences of Eſteem and Affection, they made out to the King, in ſubmitting to him ſo great differences, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of their affairs to the judgement of his Agents. But to ſell this honour to him at a very dear rate, they preſſed th'union whereof I have ſpoken; Union which they had long in their thoughts, and had ſought ſince <hi>France</hi> was delivered of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Invaſions, and had ſecured her ſelfe of their Ambuſhes; Union to which they aimed with the ſame heat they did at the Monarchy, ſince it was to be the Bridge to paſſe them ſafely, and the neceſſary principle for the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine of other Chriſtian States, and loſſe of their liberties.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bentivoglio Nonce,</hi> and now a Cardinall and Protector of <hi>France,</hi> joyned his good endeavours to thoſe of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Embaſſadour, in favour of that ſo much deſired Union and fatall Intelligence.</p>
                  <p>However if that deſign fail, they would have peace, not being able any longer to make War: That <hi>Gradiſque</hi> which the <hi>Venetians</hi> beſieged, was upon its laſt breath; That the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Savoy</hi> ſwollen with the reliefe was come to him from <hi>France</hi> was powerfull, and <hi>Don Petro</hi> of <hi>Toledo</hi> weak, and his Army ſhattered ſince the ſiege of <hi>Vercel.</hi> They would have, I ſay, peace, but after their manner, and upon a vain ſhadow of honour which they believed to have done us, and upon a light ſmoak of difference wherewith they thought to have intoxicated us. They would exempt themſelves from Evils which hung over their heads; they would have it neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe with vapouring and reputation; as if fortune had been propitious to them; They would have no mention made of it in the Treaty of the reſtitution of the Ships of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique, and that the Ships ſhould remain with them as Trophies of a Victory, and as marks of Triumph: They promiſe to deliver them to the King's Officers, as a great Bounty which ſhould be exerciſed for love of them, and to oblige <hi>France;</hi> They would not alſo that any expreſſe or particular mention ſhould be made of <hi>Vercel;</hi> In regard, it was more convenient, ſay they, for the greatneſſe and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their Crown, to deliver up that place without Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, as they promiſed to do, than by a Treaty of Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation;
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:99746:22"/>Our Agents induced by Cauſes, which were then, it may be, lawfull, and which would not be indured in the generoſity of the preſent Government, engage th'Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors of the Republique between two extreams; They preſs them to ſign the peace upon the foreſaid Conditions, or threaten them with th'union which would have been ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious to <hi>Italy.</hi> A ſtrange and hard neceſſity to which they were reduced; They deſire time to informe the Senate, and to receive thereupon their pleaſure. 'Tis refuſed, and three dayes only are given them to reſolve; of the two Evils where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Election was to be made, they choſe the leſſe, and accept of a ſhameful peace; and, contrary to their inſtructions, to avoid an inconveniency which contained an Evill, they had order to fly, and th'other Evills they had cauſe to fear, which were comprehended in th'union: They offend but for the good of the Republique: They expoſe their heads, but for the good of their Country: They would periſh if their ruine might ſerve their Country. The <hi>Senate</hi> adviſed of what their Ambaſſadours had done: Condemn their proceedings, and reſolve to make them examples of their Temerity: All their reaſons though neceſſary are rejected, And if the King had not interpoſed his authority for the ſafety of the poor men, they had run the hazard of being expoſed to that Juſtice of State which attributes ſo much to Conformity, that it makes no diſtinction betwixt the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py and the guilty, and that ſeeks ordinarily th'advancement of the publique good in the ruine of particular perſons. Certainly it was to the advantage of the Republique, to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace that peace, as it did, and to take it as a medicine, to cure it ſelfe of a greater Evill that threatned it. The Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique had reaſon alſo to ſeem willing to preſerve her Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and for th'intereſt of the right of Nations, to puniſh her Embaſſadours that dared to be wiſer then the Republique, and procure her good againſt her Prohibition.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are onely gentle Notions, and 'tis a Conduct that ought not to hurt a Miniſter of State, when he is deſavo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of things treated upon by his own propenſities: and a Prince may ſometimes lawfully make uſe of the advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges which befall him upon a Treaty he diſavoweth, without being obliged to repair the fault which another Prince hath committed by his facility and ſottiſhneſs. And it would not be thought ſtrange, ſince that as well in the Commerce of Princes as of particular perſons, the fortune of wiſe men is ordinarily made at th'expence of fools, &amp; the good ſucceſs that happens, proceeds more from the Defects, and impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of them with whom they have to do, then from th'in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:99746:22"/>and virtue of them that, obtain it. Behold an Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple which happened under <hi>Lewis</hi> the twelfth, which will make clear what hath been ſaid. It was in a ſeaſon when almoſt all Chriſtendom conſpired againſt us, and when the Aſſauls of almoſt all our Neighbours were at one Time to be reſiſted; The moſt dreadfull Nation of that time was without doubt, that of the <hi>Suiſſes,</hi> and the greateſt Enemy to this Crown. They entred into <hi>Burgundy</hi> with the body of an Army, and in great Numbers; They begin ſuddenly to make deſolate that Province: They made dayly progreſs, and made no queſtion of ſtarving <hi>Paris,</hi> and to force Victory to its very Gates. The King ſends <hi>Tremoville</hi> to allay this Tempeſt, and ſtop this impetuous inundation; He makes haſte, and as he was a great perſon for war and buſineſs, he managed the ſpirit of the people with ſo much dexterity, that he ſends them home to their Country loaden with ſome ſpoils, and promiſes he made them, and hopes he had given them. Th'Artifice was profitable to <hi>France,</hi> the ſtorm that threatned it was diverted, and the ſtroak we could not have put back by violence, was avoided by cunning. But never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs the King did not think himſelfe obliged to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme what <hi>Tremoville</hi> had promiſed without his Order, nor to be warrant for th'imprudency of the <hi>Suiſſes,</hi> who aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned their preſent Advantages, and them that the future did infallibly promiſe them, for uncertain promiſes and vain Hopes.</p>
                  <p>When I conſider the noyſe which the <hi>Suiſſes</hi> made for the breach of that Treaty, and how odious and new that. Artifice was unto them: when I conſider th'Art of deceiving, which ſince hath been introduced, and which ſhews it ſelfe impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently in th'affairs of Princes: when I conſider alſo the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality uſed by <hi>Lewis</hi> the twelfth, in th'obſervation of the League at <hi>Cambray,</hi> in making Conqueſts for Princes that were not friends to <hi>France,</hi> and in putting them into their hands, and the maintaining of them unto them; I ſay unto my ſelfe, that the time is very unfortunate, where the vices of our Anceſtors are become our virtues; where in ſtead of gaining knowledge, an Expedient is found to corrupt the Manners of men with reaſon; and where, in ſtead of ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to reconcile Virtue with Intereſt, and with perſonall love, men have ſo ſhamefully falſified and diſquieted in ſuch ſort the Reſentments of Good and Evill, That if Religion had not forbid us to believe it, we ſhould be of <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> judgement, who doubts in ſome places; whether Virtues are good by nature, or by the opinion and conſent of men.</p>
                  <p>It muſt not be forgot that there are Princes who would
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:99746:23"/>that their Miniſters of State ſhould ſometimes be cruell and forſworn, provided that it were done without their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and order, They love not malice, but ſeek the profit that may thence ariſe, and are of the humour of <hi>Pompeye's</hi> Son, who was ſo worthy a ſucceſſor of the virtue of ſo great a Father, and conteſted with <hi>Anthony</hi> and <hi>Auguſtus</hi> th'Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of the world. This <hi>Pompey</hi> entertaining <hi>Anthony</hi> and <hi>Augustus</hi> in his <hi>Galley;</hi> the Captain which commanded it, demanded leave of him to weigh th'Anchor, and to carry away his Gueſts, and to make Priſoners of his Rivalls; He anſwered him, that he ought to have done it without telling him of it, and ſhould have made him great without making him forſworn. Certainly an honeſt perſon will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be of the mind of this Captain. He will ſerve his maſter with his Eſtate and Goods, but not with his Honour and Conſcience.</p>

                  <p>Particular perſons may part with their Rights in many things, and make voluntary loſſes to act generous Actions; In that they exerciſe onely what belongs to them, they loſe nothing but whereof they are Maſters and Proprietaries, and the Damage they ſuffer is ſufficiently requited by the glory of the good they do; But Princes, (and this the more ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerns the Miniſters of State) inſtead of being generous in forſaking th'intereſt of their Countries become impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; and they are unjuſt if they proſtitute what is not theirs, and which hath been put into their hands as a ſacred Depoſite, by the people who have ſtripped themſelves of it. And ſince their firſt obligation is to prevent their unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, who have delivered up their Liberties unto them, and have put themſelves under their power: 'Tis certain, that they offend their Dignity, and ſin againſt what they are, who ſuffer the loſs of any Right of State, or of the diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:99746:23"/>of any member; and that the ſubjects may oppoſe it with Juſtice, and diſſent without Felony; According to this Rule which is well grounded, the State of <hi>France</hi> had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to hinder th'Alienation of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and the Aſſignment of that Province, which <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt had promiſed for the price of his Liberty: And th'Emperour was to blame to refuſe money in lieu of it, and to require of <hi>Francis,</hi> that being unable in that caſe to perform the Conditions of the Treaty, or overcome the reſiſtance of his subjects; He ought to return to priſon, which was, ſaid he, the leaſt he could do: ſince in all Rigour that Obligation had no force, but in the not-obſervance of what wholly depended upon him, and was promiſed fraudulently, and with intention to break promiſe. That, if it be permitted to a particular perſon, to get out of priſon when he finds the door open; If it be not forbidden to a perſon in Chaines, to force his fetters, and to quit his miſery; If ſome impreſſions of the priviledges of nature to the perſon eſcaped, may be found in the right of Nations; why ſhould it not be commendable in a great Prince, to make uſe of it? Why ſhould it be forbidden him to preſerve the good gained upon a faithfull account, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing, by what is in his power, what he could not execute by being at the diſpoſition of another.</p>
                  <p>'Tis upon this foundation, in my judgement, that Princes who finding in their States ſome Member thereof to have been uſurped by their Predeceſſors, retain it in conſcience, after the poſſeſſion hath been long peaceable, and the occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation not interrupted nor conteſted. For in this, 'tis the Uſuper that ought to anſwer the action, and that hath been obliged to repair th'injury that hath been committed, and the violence that hath been exerciſed, otherwiſe truly the Conditions of all Princes were miſerable; They could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be aſſured of their States; They ſhould be alwaies in quarrell with their Neighbours, and the peace of the world ſhould be altered by too frequent Changes, and by eternall revolutions. It is nevertheleſs true, that although the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention be not unjuſt, and in Conſcience be defended; yet that hinders not the juſt pretenſions of others to thoſe States, or that they may not alſo in Conſcience purſue the recovery of them by Negotiation or by Arms; Provided nevertheleſſe, that there be no Treaty nor Agreement equall to it, by which they have renounced their right; that they have done no action contrary to it; and that ſo great a time be not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſed, that the place be held by a formall demiſſion of the right, and embrace the univerſall Conſent of all Nations, and of all people in favour of the poſſeſſor. So the King may
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:99746:24"/>lawfully keep <hi>Mess, Thou,</hi> and <hi>Verdum,</hi> though theſe places had been unjuſtly taken; ſo we may pretend in Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Soveraignty of <hi>Flanders,</hi> and to the States of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan, Naples,</hi> and <hi>Navarre,</hi> ſince we have for that, Pretences well grounded, and undoubted Titles: that our Claimes have alwaies been made; that they are known of all the world; and that we have not by Treaty nor Action, deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the force of them; ſo we ſhould be condemned to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour the recovery of the loſſes of the firſt ſucceſſors to <hi>Charlemaine,</hi> and to deter thoſe quarrells whereof with dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty Hiſtory hath perſerved any intire impreſſions, or any light that were not troubled.</p>
                  <p>That if Soveraigns are bound up with ſo great rigour and hard Chains for the good of the people, who are their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; How much more ought the Miniſters of State, and Agents whom they imployed to be bound up: And how religious ought they to be in the management of the thing that concerns ſo many perſons, which enlargeth it ſelfe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſacred and prophane heads, and where th'intereſt of God mixeth with that of men; 'Tis not to be underſtood by what hath been ſaid, that I would baniſh Liberality and Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cences from the life of <hi>Princes,</hi> and from the condition of publique perſons; nor that I would cauſe theſe virtues to deſcend below the Thrones, and below the Purple, ſince they are properly there, onely in their Glory and Dignity; and that Great perſons have no other advantage of mean perſons that are honeſt men, then th'ability of doing good, which others have onely in Will and Inclination, for want of power. But there's a peculiar art in conducting of theſe Virtues, without which they paſs eaſily into the nature of the Vice that is neareſt to them; and reſemble Torrents, which in ſtead of refreſhing, deſtroy, and in preſſing too hard the courſe of their waters, and to precipitate their fall, are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently dry, and leave nothing behind them but marks of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, and impreſſions of ruine. But thereof I ſhall treat in another place; Let us return to the ſubject from whence we parted, and give the King th'honour, that no Prince ever had more tender or lively reſentments, for th'intereſt of his States, or for the dignity of his Kingdom, then himſelfe. There's nothing ſo hazardous that this paſſion did not cauſe him to undertake, nor nothing ſo difficult that it hath not maſtered. It hath made him change th'apparance of things, ſuch as appeared impoſſible, have been affected; and th'Evils which were believed deſperate, have found their remedies and Cure. He had no reſt till he had made himſelfe maſter of all his Subjects, and he hath conſtrained them to be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:99746:24"/>who knew not to obey ſo long as they could defend themſelves. He went abroad in all places where our Intereſts lay: The relations of blood concerned him not ſo much as thoſe of his Crown: All other Duty hath given place to that of Regality, and he hath the content to have rendred unto it intirely, the two things that maintain it, Reputation and Power.</p>
                  <p>But 'tis not to be forgot, that God hath raiſed a Perſon to ſecond his great and juſt inclinations, who having an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and virtue above the Ordinary of men, hath im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed all his wit and virtue for his Maſters Greatneſs and Glory; He laid aſide the conſideration of a particular Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, ſo ſoon as he became a publique perſon; nothing could divert him from doing his Prince good ſervice: He feared not the hatred of great perſons, nor the bitings of the people. And he kept his way and pace at well through the contradictions and reſiſtance was made him, as through th'ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations received, and the prayers given him. Then alſo when he might have landed after a glorious Voyage, when Envy was ſilent, and reduced to obſerve the future; finding nothing in his paſt Actions for reproof, but for Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when he might have enjoyed the ſweetneſſe of that Reſt which attends happy troubles, and honourable labours. He would not, becauſe it was neceſſary for us; that all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine winds were not laid, and that diſturbances were buſie amongſt our Neighbours and Allies. He choſe rather to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a full and entire glory, as his was, to the hazards of the future alwayes doubtfull, and ſubject to revolutions, than to permit his Maſter and Country to deſire his care and aid; And that which is moſt admirable, is, that his love ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, and duty ſo inviolable, have ſometimes prevailed with him to ſuſpend reſentments which troubled him nearer then his perſonall preſervation, which were dearer to him then his life, and which he preferred to all his fortune at Court, and to all the greatneſs of the world. In purſuance of this, I ſay alſo what concerns the manners of particular perſons and their Government; Charity commands us to lay out on them the beſt Colours, and moſt favourable Interpretations. But when the queſtion is of the good of States and Intereſt of Princes, a greater ſeverity of Judgement muſt be uſed. All appearances of Evill muſt be attended with diſtruſt, and divers expedients muſt be uſed to avoid ſurpriſes, and to ſecure againſt Ambuſhes. The reaſon is, that 'tis not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to commit ſmall faults in ſuch great and general mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and that the will doth not engage to prepare us againſt deceit, when a great opinion is had of the honeſty of the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:99746:25"/>perſons that are to be treated withall. But if precaution be at any time neceſſary, and if there be need at any time of preſervatives againſt ſo ſubtill and piercing a contagion; 'tis principally in that ſeaſon, when Treachery makes a part of politique Prudence, and where the ſimplicity of them who ſuffer the ſurpriſe, is more ſhamefull then the perfidy of them that deceive to their own advantage; Add th'Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices that are imployed to diſguiſe it, and the ſubtilties which have been invented to repreſent it under another name then its own, and cauſe it to paſs under ſhews contrary to its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; inſomuch that though it be alwaies condemned by the mouth, and in Coverſations, I doe not ſee nevertheleſs that 'tis caſt out of the commerce of Princes, and uſe of affaires, but by th'event when it proves fatall; let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude then, that in theſe occaſions diffidence is the Mother of ſafety; and not to be deceived, preparation muſt be made as if it were to be expected.</p>

                  <p>THat a Miniſter of State ought to be a ſtranger to th'Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of the vulgar, that he ought not to be ſubject to the weakneſs of Low ſpirits, nor to touch upon th'ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects which entertain them.

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:99746:25"/>beautifull what Ornaments ſoever are put upon it. 'Tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that the people are provoked when a vain oſtentation is made of their ſubſtance, and a triumph of their ſweats and pains. They are amazed and at a ſtand; but in the ſame manner as they behold the pulling down of Temples, and th'overflowings of Rivers: Wiſe perſons are troubled, when the principal force of the State is diſſipated, the ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of peace, and th'inſtrument of War, which is Money, in ſuperfluous expences, ſince there's never enough for the neceſſary occaſions.</p>
                  <p>The things which I have ſaid, are chiefly in relation to the people, which aſtoniſh and raviſh them, at the inſtant they make them afraid. There are other things alſo which touch upon the great Spirits, and tranſport th'higheſt Courages; Such are th'Arms of War, and th'objects of Valour: There's no virtue in th'opinion of the greateſt part of men more in eſteem than this, and no matter is more acceptable for Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor any Entertainment more bewitching, then th'effects of War; wherefore Hiſtorians ſhun the times of peace and dead ſeaſons, as Mariners do the gentle ſeaſons and calms of the Sea; on the contrary, they triumph in War, and in Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults; the Seditions and Inſurrections of the people, are the lights of their writings; and their faireſt ſubjects and moſt excellent Arguments, are raiſed upon the Ruine of Empires, and the death of great perſons; wherefore they that frequently read <hi>Tacitus,</hi> do not ſo much fix upon the ſubtilties and deceits of State, whereof his Books are full beyond pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability; at upon the routing of the <hi>Roman</hi> Legions; upon the Revolts of Armies againſt their Generalls, upon th'inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sea, and wrack of Fleets; Th'Art of <hi>Tiberius</hi> to govern, is not read with ſo much pleaſure; nor the Artifices of <hi>Sejanus</hi> to eſtabliſh himſelfe, as the poyſoning of <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus,</hi> or the violent death of <hi>Seneca;</hi> The dexterity practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by <hi>Tiberius,</hi> in the name of <hi>Sejanus,</hi> is not ſo earneſtly conſidered, and the ſubtil and captious Letter he wrote to the <hi>Senate</hi> to be rid of him, and whereof he was an Hearer; as the puniſhment of a perſon who had raiſed his Statues to the ſide of his Maſters, and th'overthrow of that <hi>Coloſſus,</hi> who had commanded all th'Earth. 'Tis not, ſayeth <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> that Valour is the firſt of all Virtues, or that Juſtice is not to be preferred before it; but that it acts with more boldneſs then other Virtues, and is exerciſed in ſurmounting of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and in deſpiſing of death. 'Tis reaſonable that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence that is due to it from abroad, be the greater and the more eminent; that it be Crowned with Glory, and they that give their Lives to the ſervice of their Princes, and to the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:99746:26"/>good of their Country, obtain another life not ſubject to periſh; and to be preferred in the memory of men, and to flouriſh alwaies in the mouthes of the Renowned.</p>
                  <p>Though theſe things here do raiſe admiration, and that the ſpirit of man which attends naturally actions of Eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, layes out exceſſive love upon them, though a Miniſter of State ought to eſteem them highly, and honour the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct when it ſhall be neceſſary; yet he ought to proceed further, and know that there are more ſilent and concealed operations, which are better then th'others, becauſe they are more uſefull for the publique, and want of that out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward recompence; Time onely diſcovers them, in regard that ſecrecy is their principall Condition, and the wiſe one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſider them according to their merit, becauſe they make but little noyſe, &amp; touch not upon the ſenſes which make up the reaſon of the people; They reſemble the Rivers, which running gently from the womb of their Center, fill the fields with fruitfulneſs, and Cities with abundance; or the motions of the Heavens, whith being almoſt undiſcernable, turn upon the Earth the power of the Sun, and the wealth of the Stars.</p>
                  <p>To foreſee th'evills which may befall a State; to prepare preſervatives to hinder their growth; to ſuppreſs the Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes before they have produced their Effects, are things very little conſidered: And yet a greater Obligation is due to a Phyſitian, that preſerves the health from all ſorts of Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than to him that reſtores the health when it is loſt; A greater Debt is due to him that hinders a perſon from fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, then to him that draws him from a precipice; And 'tis a better and more difficult thing to preſerve a State, then to Conquer it: The preſervation of the Creatures is as noble and excellent a work of God's, as their Creation. They are both of the ſame price, and th'one is but the continuation of th'other. But it is not the ſame in Conqueſts and preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of States; The firſt are not gained but by pieces; one Province is added to another, and there's need of ſeverall Ages, and of great Revolutions of things, before a Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy can attain the Greatneſs that compoſeth it. But the ſecond takes notice of the whole frame of an Empire, no part is exempted, and the pieces which have been made one after another, ought to move together as in a Watch, and to point out th'hours. The glory of Conqueſts is derived from many Cauſes, many Perſons contribute to it; Fortune interpoſeth as well as Virtue; and the faults committed by Enemies, do advance them as much as the Conduct of the perſons that obtain them. But the conſervation, is th'effect
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:99746:26"/>of a ſingle perſon, or the work of a few perſons: Impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency enters not there but to deſtroy, and confound, and the door of Hazard, and ſo all th'Avenues of Fortune, is as ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhut as it can be locked. It Conqueſts, force mingles with prudence, and the Body acts with th'underſtanding; but in Conſervation, Reaſon onely is employed, and Wiſdom the nobleſt of her habits.</p>
                  <p>In a word, great Princes have found the laſt of theſe things more difficult then the firſt; <hi>Auguſtus</hi> endured much labour before he could confirm the Empire his Uncle left him, and it was not done without changing the face of the world, and without ſeeing all Nations armed againſt one another; That he reunited the body that was divided into three pieces. But he was ſo much troubled to maintain that Compoſition, and to govern that Frame when he became abſolute, that he had it in deliberation amongſt his friends, whether he ought to ſtrip himſelfe of ſo weighty a greatneſs, or bear it with the inſeparable Cares and Thorns that are faſtned unto it; Some have been found, who having tryed the weight, and ruſted the bitterneſs, have choſen rather to abandon it, &amp; caſt themſelve upon the quiet of a private life, then alwaies to be encum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred with a multitude of Perſons and croud of Buſineſſe. There are ſome who have given the lie to that common opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion which Ambition hath invented, <hi>That an Empire can no more receive a Companion, than the World two Sunt,</hi> and have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted others to ſhare with them in a thing ſo full of jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie as Commands, and ſo incommunicable as Soveraignty. The Conduct of <hi>Tiberius</hi> for peace hath not been leſſe admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, nor th'Artifices he uſed in his Age, leſſe exactly obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the Hiſtorians, then the Wars he made in his youth, and th'evidences of Valour which he gave in his moſt flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing time. The life of one of our Kings Which deſerved the Sirname of Wiſe, is not leſs conſiderable then the lifes of them who have carried the Titles of Conquerors; and a Prince our Neighbour, hath given him this praiſe, that no King ever raiſed fewer Armies, and that no perſon ever gave him ſo much diſturbance. The Difficulties wherewith he was aſſaulted both within and without; th'Artifices he was conſtrained to reſiſt; the Conſpiracies from which he was to be ſecured, and th'Enterpriſes of ſtrangers, which he made uſeleſſe by his prudence, delivered him to poſterity, worthy of a Title which hath been given to meaner perſons, as that of the Great.</p>
                  <p>Few Princes had greater Affairs in hand then <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleventh, or more Enemies; His principal Officers betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him; the Princes of the blood forſook him; He ſaw <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:99746:27"/>Burgundy, Flanders</hi> and <hi>Bretany,</hi> in confederacy for his Ruine, and yet his dexterity ſurmounted thoſe difficulties; He overcame his Enemies without conducting of Armies, or giving of Battails, and without making much noyſe of eminent Attempts; He defeated all that was raiſed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy him; but never perſon was more to be feared in the Cabinet, nor had done greater things abroad, without ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring from home, then <hi>Philip</hi> the ſecond. From th'<hi>Eſcuriall</hi> where he had ſhut up himſelfe; He governed two Worlds, with three fingers of Paper. He was alſo as abſolute in <hi>Peru,</hi> as in the Kingdom of <hi>Caſtile;</hi> with three words he changed the Governours, and depoſed the Magiſtrates in <hi>America,</hi> and in <hi>Japan;</hi> And 'tis certain that never Prince was leſſe ſeen of his ſubjects, nor more reſpected by them than he was.</p>
                  <p>According to what hath been ſaid, 'tis not poſſible to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a more eaven Conduct, or more intelligent then that of of <hi>Sr. the Cardinal's.</hi> He never offends againſt the convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of things, and his Intelligence is ſo pure, and Reaſon ſo cleare, that he aſſigns them alwaies their juſt price and place; He is magnificent, and ſpends with Eminency; not that he hath no eſteem naturally for wealth, or hath never adored th'Idoll of the Court, and the mean favours of Fortune; but becauſe prudence hath ſo ordained it, and that his Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and Dignity require it. He makes not nevertheleſs that glorious diſpenſation, and high uſe of Riches, which is but for ſhew, and th'exterior; the Baſis of his honour, or foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of his glory. He knows that all prodigalls have more deſire to ſpend then himſelfe, and that publique Robbers have ſometimes been ſeen in great States, who have had more power. But for th'other Imployment, which is the love of great Courages, which is th'Ornament of th' <hi>Annales,</hi> and Hiſtories, and which hath made the greateſt part of the Gods, th'Ancients have adored; It hath occaſioned in him a great conteſt of body and mind, and he hath not forgot the thing might make him to proſper in it. 'Tis true, that he was furniſhed with the principles which accompany a noble blood, and an <hi>Illuſtrious</hi> Birth: 'Tis true, that his Reaſon, and the lights of his Underſtanding, have compleated that Diſpoſition for all ſorts of Good, which nature hath infuſed into him; notwithſtanding it muſt be avowed that he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed ſuch a profeſſion of life, as had reſtrained thoſe ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Inclinations, and hindred the ſeeds to grow; If they had not been raiſed up by his love to the King, and to the neceſſities of his Country.</p>
                  <p>But he loved his Maſter too well, to ſtay in the Calm whilſt
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:99746:27"/>he was in the ſtorm; and he was too ſenſible of th'evills of <hi>France,</hi> to give onely his Counſells for its reliefe, and to ſuffer the Remedies to be applyed by other hands than his. The things which have been done in the Wars, where he was preſent, are incredible, and proſperity will be puſzled to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the wonders which happened in our time. But it muſt be confeſſed alſo, that in theſe Occaſions he did not onely contribute his Courage, and the force of his ſoul, but blend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed alſo that ſecret Art and inſenſible Addreſs, which is the higheſt degree of Civill ſcience, and the perfection of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration. And as th'encounter of two Stars of different qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, produceth here below effects which would not happen without that mixture, and confuſion of Virtues; 'Tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain alſo, that th'Induſtry which <hi>Sr. the Cardinall</hi> added to the Power, hath advanced the Kings Victories, and made them eaſie. It mollified th'hearts which could not have been broken but with great difficulty; It opened the Gates of Cities, where it had been dangerous to have entred by Breaches; it ſpared blood that was not to be deſpiſed, and an infinite number of lifes which have not been unprofitable to the State.</p>
                  <p>What hath not this Art done in the midſt of peace, and in the quiet of affairs? how many deſigns, which had been fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall to <hi>France,</hi> have been ſtifled in their Conception? How many ſtorms diverted at the very inſtant that the matter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to gather? and how many ill affections have remained barren for having been prevented? And abroad and amongſt our Neighbours, hath not the ſame Art made diſcovery of its virtue and influence? It hath diſappointed the ſubtilties of <hi>Italy,</hi> from doing of us any harm; That th'Artifices of <hi>Spain</hi> have not ſurpriſed us, and that we have ſurmounted the prudence of ſtrangers as well as their forces. That Prince beyond the Mountains that lived ſo many yeares, and raign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo long time, who alwaies repaired his weakneſſe with his Crafts and his Courage; and deceived Fortune ſo often, that had made it her deſign to deſtroy him; had the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure to ſee his Charmes defeated, his Fineſſes diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and all that inverted upon him, which an experience of above fifty years, and the vivacity of his ſpirit, had furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with, of inventions to hurt us; The <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who have alwaies ſuch plenty of means to attain their Ends, who ſet ſuch ſubtill and inviſible Twigs to catch other Nations, and have often finiſhed in their Treaties the deſigns began in their Wars, were amazed to find a perſon ſo ſubtil as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; And, as the covetous perſons believe they have loſt
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:99746:28"/>all they do not gain, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have complained that they were deceived, when they ſaw that we knew how to hinder their deceit.</p>

                  <p>SInce this eloſe Art, whereof we have now ſpoken, is ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for States, and gives ſometimes ſuch extraordinary ſtroaks; ſince its hidden influences are ſo powerfull; ſince that its ſecret virtue is ſo active: Lets ſee a little from what ſpring is runs, and with what forces 'tis accompanied. There's no queſtion, but for this as for all great Actions, the birth muſt be happy; Th'aſpects of the Stars muſt be favourable, and Nature propitious to us, otherwiſe 'tis to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in vain. If it be contrary to us, 'tis to build without a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, 'tis to ſow ſeeds on the Rocks; or, at beſt, 'tis to row againſt the ſtream of a rapid River. When Nature and Birth have diſtributed their Gifts and Advantages, there are two things which help to gain this Art, and to forme it, Learning and Experience. We have treated thereof in the firſt Diſcourſe of this Book. But in regard the firſt of them is ordinarily too little eſteemed by them who make no uſe of it, but as an unprofitable moveable, and ſuperfluous Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament. And that 'tis ſometimes too much neglected by them, who have great Obligations upon them to be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with it. Who have no motions but what are accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with publique Intereſt; no paſſions but ſuch as are fatall to a State, and whoſe faults reſemble the irregularities of the Sun which confound th'Harmony of the World, and make a totall change in Nature: It may not be ſuperfluous, beſides what hath been ſaid in other places, to raiſe it here a little, and to withdraw it from the diſdain which ſome would throw upon it.</p>
                  <p>The aneient <hi>Romans,</hi> whoſe leaſt praiſe is, that they have not been imitated by any other Nation. They who were ordained to Govern the Common-wealth, that commanded all the world; They who had Commiſſion to lead Armies, and ſubdue free people, became hearers of the Rhetoricians, and Diſciples of the Philoſophers: And though in the firſt Times, and golden Age of that Republique, the ſtudy of Sciences was not known, and that the perſons of that time were inſtructed onely by Nature, and had no other Precepts to live well and to well, but th'Examples of their prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:99746:28"/>and fellow Citizens. Though old <hi>Cato</hi> who deſerved all the praiſe of a perſon born for the good of others; who in his Country gained all th'honours of Peace and War; who raiſed the queſtion, whether he was a better Citizen or greater Captain, ſeems to have been an Enemy to men of Letters; The Judgement nevertheleſſe of a ſingle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, nor the Conſent of a few Ages, are not even infallible, nor the ſoveraign Rule of the truth of things.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, that there are Sciences ſo ſuperfluous, and occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations of the Underſtanding ſo frivolous, that the loſſe of time is the leaſt Evill committed by them that make their Addreſs; which do not onely puſzle but corrupt; which divert from Action diſſipate the powers of the ſoul; fill it with effeminate Habits, and make a man ſometimes unable to ſerve the publique, or to be uſefull to himſelfe. And ſuch were the Sciences from which no doubt <hi>Cath</hi> endeavoured to divert the <hi>Romane</hi> youth. But as for other Sciences that form th'underſtanding and refine Prudence; which rectifie Manners, and regulate the Duties of life; that fortifie Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and kindle the deſires of Glory; He could never have conſented, as I conceive, to the baniſhment of them from <hi>Rome,</hi> if they had been there taught, he would not have driven away the <hi>Socratians,</hi> the <hi>Platonists,</hi> th' <hi>Ariſtotelians,</hi> and th'other Maſters of human kind, as he did the <hi>Greek</hi> Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; He would have known that from their Schools, did iſſue th' <hi>Epimanendas's,</hi> the <hi>Xenophons,</hi> and th' <hi>Alexanders;</hi> He had known that the Republiques called for them in Order to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and that Tyrants ſent for them to ſecure their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, and to make lawfull the countenance of a power whoſe beginning was unjuſt.</p>
                  <p>That if Ages ſometimes have produced great perſons for Peace and War, who became ſuch without th'ayd of Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and the lights of Philoſophy; If the <hi>Gothes</hi> could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure in their Country th'exerciſe of Learning. If ſome Pagan Emperours have judged it for the beſt Expedient to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the hearts from Chriſtians, to leave them that ſullen contemplation, and that languiſhing Entertainment; And if <hi>Lewis the Eleventh</hi> would not ſuffer his Son to learn above five or ſix Latine words, which he believed to include the whole ſecret of Government, and to comprehend all the ſubſtance of that Art. As to the firſt, it muſt be confeſſed, that they were the ſtrains of Nature which fortune favours; that they were perſons of very good common ſenſe, and of very high Courage, and compleated by th'uſe of Affairs, and managment of Wars which they governed: Such have been the <hi>Marians,</hi> the <hi>Tamberlaines,</hi> and the firſt <hi>Romanes</hi>
                     <pb n="48" facs="tcp:99746:29"/>whereof we have above ſpoken. But it muſt be alſo acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that if ſtudy had been added to the rich gifts of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and if Philoſophy had cleared their underſtandings, that their valour had been fairer, and their glory more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent; That it had not been ſtained with ſo many faults as it was, and that their valour ſo high and happy in their Youth, for being rooted in the body, had nor failed, nor departed in Age, as it hapned to ſome of them.</p>
                  <p>That if th'health of the Common-wealth changed, when Sciences flouriſhed much at <hi>Rome,</hi> and if it fell in a time when its Captains were Philoſophers; Philoſophy for that Cauſe muſt not be charged with it. You muſt not condemn th'innocent, nor believe that ſhe who laboured to moderate the paſſions, and to purge the ſoul of its blots and weakneſs, did infuſe that violent Diſire to raign, and that immoderate Ambition, which could not be reſtrained, neither by the inclinations of blood, nor by the love of their Country. This great diſorder then proceeded from the temper of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſpirits, who after they had a long time commanded in thoſe Provinces, and given Lawes to the people, could not reduce themſelves to equality, and civill obedience, nor ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Companions and Maſters. Moreover that whilſt the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> were imployed, and that ſtranger Enemies exerciſed them at home, they thought onely of ſubduing or defending themſelves. But ſince all the world yeelded to their Virtue, or ſubmitted to their Power; that with the Conqueſt of the World, the wealth of all Nations was brought to <hi>Rome:</hi> That great perſons made many ſervants and parties in the midſt of the City, and in the Provinces: That Prodigality and Luxury had devoured the beſt Families, and that the change of ſtate had given hopes of the change of fortune to them, who could not be worſe then in their preſent Condition; no wonder at the diſorders that hapned. It muſt not be thought ſtrange if Factions were raiſed where Ambition was ſo hot: if Novelty was deſired, where there was ſo much Poverty, and ſo much Wealth: and if the Ruine of one of the parties was attended with the ruine of the State, where the power that was ſhared became abſolute by victory.</p>
                  <p>As to the ſecond, it may be agreed, that for the ſimple fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Souldiers, 'tis not of importance that they be furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with knowledge and Learning. And 'tis true, that thoſe Qualities which ordinarily ſwell up th'underſtanding and make it overflow; weaken obedience which is ſo neceſſary for them, and render them leſſe tractable for commands; chiefly if they have not a great opinion of their Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; which they have but ſeldom, becauſe they have too
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:99746:29"/>much for themſelves. Beſides that preſumption which ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to them from the ſmall advantages which Letters give them above others that have them not; cauſeth, them not to expoſe themſelves willingly but upon th'eminent occaſions, and that they ſcorn to apply themſelves to mean and ſmall Factions, which are often a great occaſion for great Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and to obtain the Victory. Wherefore <hi>Lodowith Sforza,</hi> who by his Ambition overthrew the peace of <hi>Italy,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened the door to Strangers, who have ſince ſubdued it, ſaid, <hi>That a great Wit made an ill Condition in a Souldier, and that he received not eaſily into his ſervice them who were proud of it:</hi> 'Tis true alſo, that it infinitely concerns States that are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to entertain great Armies, and are jealous of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Commerce, without which they become poor, and the Revenue of the Prince decayes; That there be not ſo great a number of Scholers, as are ſeen in <hi>France;</hi> That irregular number of men who caſt themſelves into the Church, ir into th'exerciſe of Juſtice, is the cauſe that ſuch formidable Armies, as heretofore cannot be raiſed, and that many who would make good Merchants, and their Families to flouriſh, if they had been bred in Trade, ruine or incommodate them, by becomming ill Doctors, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous or unprofitable Members of the Court of Juſtice.</p>
                  <p>For what concernes <hi>Lewis th'Eleventh,</hi> it muſt not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood that his opinion comprehends all the duty of a Prince, and all the knowledge of Government it makes but a little and dangerous party, and that there are nobler Maximes for Raigning, and more exalted Principles, than diſſimulation. And truly the ſeeds of good which were in his Son, remained imperfect for want of improvement. His Courage that was high, wanted Rule and Conduct, and his Underſtanding had not force enough to reſiſt the Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them, that had invironed him, and the deſigns of his Miniſters of State, who ruined his buſineſſe to doe their own.</p>

                  <head type="sub">That 'tis of importance that a Miniſter of State be Eloquent.</head>
                  <p>YOu have what I would ſay in defence of Letters, which help to forme th'Art of a Miniſter of State, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſerve for a Guid, and Torch, to them who are to walk ofton in the dark, and amongſt Precipices. It remaines now to ſpeak a word of Eloquence, which is as th'hand of that
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:99746:30"/>Art and Inſtrument wherewith it enters the hearts, ſtirs up the paſſions, gives to things the form ſhe pleaſeth, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders her ſelfe Miſtreſs of Men and Buſineſſes. 'Tis a quality of an incomparable perfection which requires all the favours Nature can beſtow upon a Body and Wit: All the poliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings that Labour and Induſtry can bring unto it, and all that good Cuſtome and Experience can adde unto it. 'Tis ſo full alſo of Glory, that 'tis never expoſed to Diſdains, as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Sciences are. She makes her ſelfe to be feared, if not to be beloved; ſhe hath Lightnings as well as Crowns. She raigns in all places, and to that height, that ſhe under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to change the order of Providence, and to take away the uſe of Liberty from the Cauſes, to which God had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven it.</p>
                  <p>This Quality then which cannot be perfect, nor in its true Dignity without Virtue and Philoſophy, is worthy of the Cares of a Miniſter of State. It wonderfully adornes Peace, and is of great ſervice in time of War. 'Tis by her power that th'Ancient Orators protected the Innocency of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar perſons, and defended oppreſſed Provinces. 'Tis by her force, that the fall of States hath been ſometimes prevented; and fatall Conſpiracies diſſipated. 'Tis by her, that <hi>Cicero</hi> me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited honours, which he preferred to the Triumph of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors. And by her, he pretends to have place amongſt the Founders and Reſtorers of the firſt Common-wealth of the world. 'Tis ſhe that hath often ſecured the Victories that were doubtfull; that hath given courage to the Souldiers that had loſt it; that ſtruck fire and boldneſſe into the ſouls of them who compelled Fortune to favour them, and that would die or overcome.</p>
                  <p>And without ſpeaking of <hi>Xenophon,</hi> of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and of the greateſt Captains of Antiquity; who have gained in the Modern Ages a higher and clearer Reputation than <hi>Scander-beg</hi> than the great Captain, and than <hi>Gaſton of Foix?</hi> And is it not true that theſe three great perſons have alwaies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to prepare the Victory by Diſcourſe, and by perſwaſion, which after they compleated by Conduct and Valour, In ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, it is no ſmall favour which God hath done to the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ſoul, by giving it power to communicate its thoughts, and to bring to light its affections; And Speech is a preſent of an extraordinary price, wherewith ſhe may diſtribute part of her excellencies: She can give without loſſe, and make rich without becoming poor; ſhe can ſee the Treaſures abroad ſhe hath within her ſelfe, the Lights that beautifie her, and thoſe admirable Repreſentations whereof ſhe is at the ſame time the Painter and the Table:
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:99746:30"/>And 'tis for that chiefly, that ſhe hath received ſo exquiſite a Guift: For in relation onely to the Body, and the ſingle ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities of th'animall life, 'Tis probable that Nature would have given it certain ſigns, and ſome exterior Motions to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs them, as it hath done to Beaſts and little Children. But as health of it ſelfe is a ſilent good, and is ſcarce felt, if pleaſure do not animate it, and delight give it life; ſo the Dignity of Speech is unknown, if it be not accompanied with Graces, and expreſſed with Pomp.</p>
                  <p>It ſeems that Reaſon ſcorns to go abroad unleſs ſhe be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned; that ſhe hath no force without allurements; and effects Complaiſancy, that ſhe may be uſeful: And 'tis Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and that divine faculty whereof we ſpeak, which fits and trims Reaſon to ſo high an Admiration; 'Tis ſhe that doth furniſh her with Flowers and Ornaments; 'Tis ſhe that cauſeth Reaſon not onely to bring Light to be underſtood, but alſo ſtirs up Love to be followed.</p>
                  <p>I will not ſpeak here of the knowledge of <hi>Sr. the Cardinal,</hi> nor of the wonder, that laying out ſo much time for Action and Directions for publique Affairs, there ſhould remain to him any time for his ſtudy, and for to gain that generall knowledge he hath of all good things. It were alſo to be ignorant of his ſtrength and dignity of his ſubject To ſpeak of his Eloquence, it were to ſeek light from the Sun, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake the publiſhing of that Divine Faculty which is every day admired in Councills: which hath ſo eminently appeared in Aſſemblies, done ſo great ſervices to <hi>France,</hi> and hath ſo often by his Mouth and Pen made the Chriſtian truths to Triumph. 'Tis ſuch, and his ſoul is ſo ſtrangely imbued, that as there are places in the world, from whence nothing is taken, but what is perfumed and odoriferous; In liker manner, even the moſt familiar Diſcourſes, and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Entertainments of <hi>Sr. the Cardinall,</hi> hold forth ſome Tincture, and give ſome taſte of the virtue fo that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent quality.</p>

                  <head type="sub">That the Councill of a Prince ought to be compoſed a few perſons.</head>
                  <p>'TIs of importance that the Councill of a Prince be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to a few Heads, ſo as they be well choſen; and that the number be not the Evidence of his Dignity, but the Merit and Virtue of his Counſellors. Unity is the laſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the perfection of things; and the firſt of all Beings,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:99746:31"/>is the moſt ſingle of all others. This Being is God himſelfe, who without ſuffering Diviſion of Parts, or mixture of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, is infinitely perfect within, and infinitely active without, and by a power infinitely pure, and infinitely ſingle, and without th'adjunction of any forraine virtue, hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the wonders we ſee, and that variety of ſubjects which are united to make the world: And without him the moſt noble Natures, and moſt excellent, are the leaſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and the moſt indiviſible; And we rejoyce much more in a ſight not limited in th'extents of its objects, and that can know all the colours of Nature, and the Figures of all Bodies; then if we had as many eyes as the viſible Objects are divers, and Colours different in nature.</p>
                  <p>So, if it were permitted to make faire Dreams and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent Wiſhes, it were to be deſired that a Prince alone ſhould make up his Councill: That he were the ſole Director of his buſineſs; That he were the ſole intelligence to give it mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that he alone held the Helme, and handled the Scepter. But inſomuch that ſuch a Prince was never ſeen, and that th'Idaea remaines in th'head of <hi>Xenophon,</hi> that Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry doth not propoſe the like to us; that th'imperfection of humane things ſuffers it not;<note place="margin">Lewis the Eleventh.</note> and that he who boaſted that his Horſe carried him and all his Councill, did ſometimes commit ſuch enormous faults and fooliſh errours, that all the world takes notice of them. A Prince ought at leaſt ſo to order his buſineſs, that his power be not looſe, that it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large not, and be reſtrained to a few perſons, that it may be the more active and abſolute, and its operation the more nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and efficacious. But that the goodneſs of this order may appear the better, and th'advantages that accrew to a State, where it is obſerved to be the more evident; It may not be amiſs to demonſtrate it by the compariſon of other formes of Government which are more diſunited, and where the Authority to reſolve buſineſſe is more dilated; for the things of this world do appear beſt by oppoſition; the ſhadow quickens the colours and the Lights; Recovery from ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is more agreeable then health: and there's no good that would not loſe one halfe for its juſt price, if there were no evill contrary to it; I will ſay upon the ſubject in hand, a word of the Republique of <hi>Venice,</hi> of that of the <hi>Suiſſes,</hi> and of the Government of the <hi>Polaques,</hi> which is a mixt kind of Government, and compoſed of <hi>Ariſtocracy</hi> and <hi>Monarchy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I think that no Republique was ever eſtabliſhed with ſo great Wiſdome, or that received Orders more apt to attain th'ends of a civill life, which is the happineſſe of Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, then that of <hi>Venice:</hi> 'Tis not but that ſome have
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:99746:31"/>made a greater noyſe in the world, and whoſe Empire hath been more enlarged, &amp; Dominion more glorious. But as the greateſt bodies, and of higheſt ſtature, are not ever the ſoundeſt; and as the vaſteſt buildings are not alwaies the firmeſt: ſo the good policy of a State, and the goodneſſe of its Compoſition, is not to be judged by th'extent of the Country it enjoys, &amp; by the great quantities of Earth and Sea it commands; ſo whoſoever conſiders the duration of the Republique of <hi>Venice,</hi> and its quiet for 1200 years, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves that it hath never been ſtrongly agitated within, and hath felt but a leight inteſtine ſedition; may eaſily conclude that the Noble parts have been very ſound, and that the Foundations are very deep and ſolid: And though of late it may ſeem that her Forces are diminiſhed, that her beſt condition is paſt, and that the violence of ſome ſtrange cauſe hath blaſted the beauty of her Countenance; there's no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of aſtoniſhment, nor any great wonder that old Age ſhould produce wrinckles; that what is mortall ſhould be ſometimes ſick; that the ſtrong ſhould offend the weak: and that Prudence ſhould not alwayes be Miſtreſs of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, nor good events the neceſſary effects of good Counſels.</p>
                  <p>Though this be thus, yet there's ſome change to be wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as to the manner of their Treating, and reſolving th'af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires of that Republique; and 'tis a great miſchief, that they are carryed through ſo many Aſſemblies, and paſs by ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Heads, whereof the Senate is compoſed; the Secret which is never very ſafe with a multitude, hath much ado to be there preſerved; Length is unavoydable there, and many times Fortune flies away, and good occaſions are loſt; whilſt they deliberate, and before they have concluded. Heretofore in preſſing-matters, and where diſpatch was requiſite, and Secrecy extraordinarily neceſſary, they were treated, and reſolved in a Councell, which they called of <hi>Ten,</hi> with the ſame force and Authority as in the Senate. But they have ſince judged, that the ſupream Authority, attributed to Ten perſons in matters regarding the whole State, was of too dangerous a conſequence, and that that Order might in time by th'Ambition, and by th'Artifices of particular perſons, degenerate into a pure Ariſtocracy, and corrupt th'eſſence of their Government, which is blended of three others.</p>
                  <p>From thence may be ſeen the fatality of humane things; that the good is ever accompanied with ſome evill, and that nothing is ſo well accompliſhed, as not in ſome part to be defective. Of all ſorts of Government, under which the world rowls, the moſt excellent are not exempt from ſpots. 'Tis not, but that they who invented them, foreſaw th'incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences:
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:99746:32"/>but that they could not do better, nor provide a Remedy, where none was to be had. Prudence is not ſo often imployed in chooſing the greateſt Good, as in avoiding the greateſt Evills; and as we ſee in the Compoſition of the humane body, that there are but a few parts capable of pleaſure, and which touch upon the pleaſant Objects: and that on the Contrary, all parts are expoſed to grief, and to ſhare Reſentments; ſo it happens that in all other things, th'evill enters by more wayes then the good, and finds more places to make its impreſſion, and exerciſe its violence. If this be to be ſeen in all of Nature, and if it be an experience which paſſeth even to Beaſts; it ought not to be thought ſtrange, if in a matter ſo mixed and ſo confuſed, as States are, and where Fancies ſo different, and Inclinations ſo va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, do enter; if the pure good be not there found, nor ſuch a perfection as no ſort of vice can alter: Let's go on.</p>
                  <p>As to the Common-wealth of the <hi>Suiſſes,</hi> 'tis a ſort of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment very looſe, and in ſome meaſure tumultuous; The Bond that tyes them, is not ſtronger than that which joyns the Leagues; and there's onely this difference; that they do but ordinarily paſs, and have no durable cauſe; that they are not good, but to repell an Evill ſuddenly fallen upon ſome of the Confederates, and which threatens the reſt of them; or to prevent ſome ſtorm and inundation of ſome great approaching power; But ſo ſoon as the danger is over, or that th'oppreſſion is taken away, they fall of themſelves, and go out for want of aliment and matter.</p>
                  <p>Of this I will treat at length in the ſecond Part of this Work. But th'Union of the <hi>Suiſſes</hi> cannot periſh nor diſſolve, but by an outward violence; It hath an everlaſting founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is jealouſie of Liberty; and though they dwell onely in Rocks, and that poverty ſtirs not from their houſes; yet they would not change their Condition, which appears not ſo ugly, but that there's great cauſe for them to be in love with it, and to believe that the Wealth which Nature hath denyed their Country, is plentifully repaired by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependency wherein they have fixed themſelves, and by the Freedom under which they live. Their Policy then, which is at greater diſtance with Unity, that that of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> is by conſequence more imperfect, and hath greater Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences: Secrecy is not to be found in their Meetings; the Convocation is made with extream tediouſneſs: Their Reſolutions are not taken but very late. And beſides th'error which is common to all Aſſemblies, To diſpute much, and conclude little; 'Tis certain the variety of Religions where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they are now in labour, cauſeth that when the Dyets are
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:99746:32"/>compoſed of all the <hi>Cantons,</hi> that intereſts more oppoſite, and paſſions more opinionated are brought, than heretofore were practiſed; And it hath been ſeen, and we have made very troubleſome experiences; that when our Forces were not fully known to us, and that our Infantry was almoſt raiſed out of <hi>Suiſſes;</hi> that the ſervices were ſo ſlowly made, and came ſo late to us, that very often we loſt fair Occaſions, or received notorious hints before we were in condition to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt or undertake; And that is one of the Reaſons which obliged <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt, to eſtabliſh Legions in the reſpective Provinces, to have the Body of an Army of <hi>French</hi> Infantry alwayes in readineſſe, and not to depend, when he had a mind to Arm, upon th'humours of that heavy Nation, and fancies of ſo brutiſh and mercenary a people.</p>
                  <p>The Government of <hi>Poland</hi> is not a pure Monarchy, as I have ſaid, but a mixt body compoſed of Ariſtocracy and Royalty. The King cannot deliberate any thing, not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take any thing for Peace or War, without th'Aſſembly of Nobles. This Conſtitution is ſubject to a thouſand incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies, and by reaſon of the tediouſneſſe it brings with it, 'tis at leaſt certain it can never receive the Deſigns, where ſucceſs depends upon the Promptitude, and where Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ought to ſurpriſe and be Suddain, that it may be Happy; 'tis an Enemy to Secrecy, which is neceſſary to guide ſafely all sorts of Enterpriſes. It gives means to enemies, to uſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, or to expect with Advantages, and to provide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Tempeſt they ſee coming, and which grumbles and makes a noyſe before it breaks out: There's nothing ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie as to ſteal-in Corruption and Schiſme, and 'tis impoſſible in ſo numerous and irregular Collection of men, as compoſe their Aſſemblies, that all parts ſhould be ſound and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable; and that all the Members ſhould agree upon the generall good of the Body, ſo compoſed. In a word, no great or extraordinary thing is to be expected from this kind of Policy, and the <hi>Polaques</hi> ought not to think of Conqueſts, or to extend by War Bounds of their Country, ſo long as they govern themſemſelves in that manner. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, they have often ſuffered great loſſes, and received no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious outrages from the Turk, from the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> and particularly from the <hi>Tartars,</hi> before they could draw their Forces together to repell them, and fight them upon their retract. And if Nature, or rather the Corruption of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, had not raiſed other Thiefs, which are called <hi>Coſaques;</hi> They would ſuffer yet more invaſions, and more ſuddain Enterpriſes from their firſt mentioned Enemies. But it ſeems that theſe <hi>Coſaques</hi> are the Counter-poyſon, and Remedy,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:99746:33"/>and often exchange it with them, and run with ruine and deſolation into their Country, and even into the Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>Turk</hi> who protects them.</p>
                  <p>And though it be thus, that this Policy hath ſo remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able faults, It would be a difficult matter to reform it: The naturall Inclination which the Septentrionalls have for li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, would make there a great reſiſtance, and I doe not think that there's a benefit, which th'abſolute and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent Authority of the King could promiſe to the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laques,</hi> which would in their opinion equalize the pleaſure and profit they find in being above their King; to do juſtice to themſelves; to provide by their own hands againſt the evils that hurt them. And in a word, to taſte of the ſoveraignty and abſolute power. To ſpeak freely, there are precipices on what ſide ſoever you look, and both extremities are attended with its Commodities, and hath its Flowers and Thornes. And as th'Ariſtocratique and mixed Government is a bridle to Princes that would abuſe their Authority, and hinders them to exceed: 'Tis true alſo, that when they have good Underſtanding, and an upright Will, the condition of their ſubjects is better them otherwiſe it would be; and the affairs of State breathe more wholſome Air, and take ſafer Courſe. All nevertheleſs being well examined, the beſt expedient is that every perſon live conformable to the Laws and Cuſtoms of his Country were he dwels; That he love the forme of Government which is there eſtabliſhed; that he obſerve the Policy there in uſe; and conceive that Change is the worſt of all Evills that can be there introduced which almoſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver enters without violence, and ever almoſt tears up that which it would take from its place.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>'Is certain that a ſingle Quality makes not up the perfection of Adminiſtration; and to form it, th'higheſt powers of Man are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and the nobleſt habits of thoſe powers. It is not ſatisfied with that, nor content onely with th'inward beauty, and with private ſatisfaction. It's Inclinations are more vaſt and ambitious: It ſuffers, if it remain concealed; It deſires the Light; It will appear abroad; It muſt enlarge and communicate it ſelfe; In a word, Action is her end and her Crown, and without it, it ſhould be a treaſure half loſt: or as the veins of Gold in the boſome of th'Earth, which no perſon hath diſcovered. Her beginning is that light of the Soul, and that product of th'underſtanding, which is called Prudence. But as the light of the Sun is a generall Quality, and which alone would produce nothing; ſo Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence hath uſe of divers other Virtues to execute her Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and to give motion to her Deliberations. And again,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:99746:34"/>as thoſe Virtues have need of her Light and Influence, to know th'object whereon they ought to look and to purſue; In like manner alſo Prudence refines her ſelfe by th'exerciſe of thoſe Virtues, and by the troubles and ſtormes which the imperfection of humane diſcourſe lets fall. They take them away, and are made clearer by experience. 'Tis not neceſſary that he who deliberates ſhould alwaies execute; That he who hath a very ſound head, ſhould have alſo ſtrong Arms; nor that he who hath Prudence, ſhould have all the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues requiſite for Action; 'tis ſufficient that ſhe guide them and direct them in what ſubject ſoever they are found, and upon what matter ſoever they are imployed. But as th'Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer judgeth much better of the work of his hands, and of th'excellency of his Ideaa, when he ſees it upon the Cloth or the Marble; ſo Prudence alſo is much better aſſured of the goodneſſe of its Judgement, by th'Effects then by the ſingle Diſcourſe that precedes them, and by the ſole Agitation of the Reaſon which goes before: And in my opinion, 'tis of that perfect prudence, and which uſe hath compleated, that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> is to be underſtood, when he ſaies, <hi>That there's no true Prudence without th'other Morall Virtues.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis true, that when theſe Virtues do meet in her compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, when they dwell together, when they proceed from a common principle, and from the ſame Root; Their Conduct is more certain and more happy; Prudence is the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive upon her buſineſſe; She governs them with more tractableneſſe, and by conſtant illuminations; ſecures them with more eaſe from the Ambuſhes of Fortune, and from th'unexpected inconveniences of the times; Wherefore in matters of War, th'execution of an enterpriſe ought alwaies to be committed to him who propoſed it, provided he be a capable perſon to perform it; for therein he is excited to do well, by the glory of Succeſs, and by the jealouſie of his opinion, which is a violent and imperious paſſion; and, ſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to defend the nobleſt and moſt exalted faculty of the Soul, which is the Judgement, ſeldom abates of the Conteſt and purſuit. As alſo it is not ſafe to put th'execution of a deſign into the hands of them that voted againſt it; who will be alwaies ſlow in Action; who will bring to it but the halfe of themſelves; who will have but faint motions, and conformable to the paſſions that ſhake them, which are irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution and diſtruſt,; and who have wherewithall to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort themſelves in th'ill of ſucceſs, by the truth of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction they had made, and by the Reputation of Wiſdom, and providence they had gained to themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Though it be ſo, and much better, that be who is capable
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:99746:34"/>to reſolve, be alſo capable to execute; 'Tis nevertheleſſe a rare encounter amongſt men; and as there are but few pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces on th'Earth which bring forth all that reſpects the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the Senſes, and the neceſſities of Life; ſo, there are but few ſouls that have all the virtues proper for Governments; and it ſeems that the Law of humane Society, as that of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, would have a dependency betwixt the ſpirits of men; as there is a Commerce and Communication betwixt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Countries, and different Nations of the World, ſo the Coldneſs of <hi>Parmenio</hi> tempered th'heat of <hi>Alexander;</hi> ſo the Wiſdom of <hi>Cyneas</hi> reſtrained the Courage of <hi>Pyrrhus:</hi> ſo <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio</hi> obſerved th'orders of <hi>Laelius,</hi> and <hi>Augustus</hi> found a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in the prudence of <hi>Metaenas,</hi> and valour of <hi>Agrippa,</hi> to which nothing was impoſſible.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore a Miniſter of State that hath all theſe perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ought to be of high price with his Prince: The State ought to reverence him as an extraordinary perſon; and the virtues which being ſevered merit a price, and to be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; deſerve highly ſome new reſpect, and a particular Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, when they joyn in a ſingle ſubject for the generall good of the World: At leaſt 'tis certain, that th'ill which attends the great variety of Agents is avoided; They that uphold them, agree rarely together in the ſame Deſign: Concord is ſeldom ſound amongſt them, unleſs it be in Looks and Words, becauſe th'heart is falſe, or intereſſed; and Jealouſie is there the ſtronger, for that it propoſeth to it ſelfe the poſſeſſion of ſo great a good, as the favour of the Prince, and the power of the State; They that are onely for Counſell, and whoſe virtue ſhines only in the Cabinet Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, encline alwaies to peace how diſhonourable ſoever. 'Tis then they truly raign, when all other greatneſſe bowes to theirs. And that they ſee at their feet the glory of Armes, and the Crowns of the Victorious. On the contrary, during the War they are out of countenance, and their Authority declines in that troubleſome ſeaſon. They are darkned by a profeſſion that hath more pomp and light then theirs; And in regard that thoſe who are called to Command, are uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally extraordinary perſons, it makes them ſtrongly jealous, and apprehend th'encreaſe of power upon the ſpirit of their Maſter, and the taking of root in his Inclinations; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they endeavour to make them unprofitable, that they might be the leſſe conſiderable. They trouble them in their employments, that they might be the leſſe happy. The great Victories make them more afraid then great Loſſes, and our Generalls have often ſeen diſ-banded th'Armies they Commanded, and enterpriſes ruined, whereof the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:99746:35"/>were plauſible; for having not timely received, or in the fit Quantity the proviſions neceſſary for continuing of the War. They on th'other ſide prolong the troubles, and lengthen the confuſion to th'uttermoſt of their power, to ſubſiſt in Credit and eſteem. They love the ſtormes becauſe they help to guide the Ship? They deſire ſickneſſe, becauſe they are imployed in applying the Remedies; but neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they would have no end made, for fear of remaining idle Pylots, and uprofitable Phyſicians. Moreover they complain alwaies firſt: They frequently accuſe them of their own faults, and eaſe themſelves upon them of th'envy of their ill ſucceſſes and diſgraces that attend it.</p>
                  <p>And when it doth not ſo happen, and that there ſhould be amongſt them a perfect underſtanding and generall agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; The Obligation nevertheleſſe which ſome of them are under to receive Orders for Action from others, and that regular Dependency, is over importunate, and ſometimes pernicious; Whilſt they conſult the Councell of the <hi>Prince,</hi> occaſions do paſſe; Things take another Countenance, and ſo many unexpected Accidents happen, for which ſuddain proviſion muſt be made, that by their Violence they are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away before Remedy can be applied, and the buſineſſe periſheth for not daring to relieve it when it was in their power. This unhappineſſe hath been particularly obſerved in ſome of our Neighbours States. The <hi>Venetians</hi> have made little uſe of th'occaſions of the War, and their Generalls have often ſeen a good occaſion paſſe away before them, without daring to ſtay it, or to hinder it from flying away, becauſe they had not the <hi>Senate's Order.</hi> They begin alſo to withdraw from that dangerous Maxime, and are no more ſo ſcrupulous as they were, to permit them to act of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and to take th'Advantages which offer themſelves. It is alſo obſerved, that th'affairs of the Low Countries ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed much for the ſame reaſon towards th'end of the life of <hi>Philip the ſecond;</hi> and that they changed extreamly by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the great delayes they were conſtrained to uſe at the time of the want of his health, and decay of his age; Th'ill was, that they would take moſt cogniſance of all things when they could worſe do it, and were moſt earneſt to retain bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe when the time was elapſed. That Prince changed his Conduct, and in ſafer occaſions he was accuſtomed to give almoſt a ſoveraign Authority to them whom he imployed. The <hi>Duke of Alva</hi> had it moſt abſolute when he came into <hi>Flanders</hi> to make War to the growing Rebellion. <hi>Don John of Auſtria</hi> had it very large, when he was choſen chiefe of the Chriſtian League againſt the <hi>Turk,</hi> after the Conqueſt of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:99746:35"/>
                     <hi>Portugal;</hi> The <hi>Cardinal Albert</hi> had an unlimitted power to reform the Kingdom, and <hi>Philip</hi> the ſecond procured him a Legation, that he might act with the greater Authority, and he was at one and the ſame time abſolute Judge of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral and ſpiritual Affairs.</p>
                  <p>Inſomuch that if the <hi>Cardinall</hi> had carried with him in his ſecond journey, beyond the Mountains, a Commiſſion as am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as ſome have deſcribed it; and that the noyſe which was but a Fable, had been true, it-had not been new nor without Example; Our Neighbours have ſhewed us the way, and that Nation alſo which underſtands th'Art of governing better then any Nation in the World. But the moderation of this Lord hath been ſuch, that he ſought not any extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Power in that Occaſion: That he hath not done nor undertaken any thing, but by the expreſſe. Orders of the King, and they that have ſtudied his Life, and obſerved his demeanour, know that he hath choſen rather to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by th'Actions of the compleateſt Obedience which a Subject can give to his Soveraign, than by the particular marks of Honour and Affection which he could have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. But beyond this, let us confeſſe, that he is that extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary perſon, who hath in an eminent degree all the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities fit for governing, which are rarely ſeen, but ſevered in others; who executes what he adviſeth; appears in Calms and Tempeſts; who hath deſerved th'honour of Peace, and the triumph of War, and in whom Virtue is not limited, neither by he Condition of the Times, nor Diverſity of Affaires.</p>

                  <head>The Second Diſcourſe.</head>
                  <head type="sub">whence the Virtue of keeping a Secret proceeds, and how neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary it is for a Miniſter of State.</head>
                  <p>WE have ſhewed in the precedent Diſcourſe, how ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary it is that the Councill of a Prince be reduced to a few perſons, and how difficult it is for a multitude of perſons to keep a Secret; This may be added to th'happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the King's Raign, that never Councill was more faithfull then his, nor where the ſecret of Affaires lay more ſecure. The number is very ſmall, but of excellent perſons. Nothing is capable to untie their Tongue but when it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. They are not weak, nor to be Corrupted. Their Virtue is proof to all Trialls. That Condition is particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remarkable in him who is the Chief, and in whom reſides that Unity which is a Beam from the Soveraignty, and the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:99746:36"/>laſt meaſure of the perfection things. Few perſons have been of profounder thoughts, nor of higher exaltations of ſoul; And but few have been ſeen that could better retaine them, or that were more the Maſter of them. And never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs the beſt thoughts of the world, and the moſt happy productions of wit have this in them, that they ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble fruits which ſhould be gathered in ſeaſon, that they may be wholſome; but they have this Imperfection, that they are like to Wine, which when it is new, endeavours to break out and to run out: The wit of man is ſo in love with it ſelfe, and hath ſo hot a thirſt to make it ſelfe known; that ſo ſoon as it hath conceived ſomething which may, as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves, deſerve praiſe, hath impatience to diſcover it: It makes haſte to bring it to light; it cannot attend the juſt time of delivery; and it ordinarily falls out, that it loſeth by too much haſte the value of what would have been excellent, if it had been brought forth in ſeaſon, and had ripened at lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. Beſides this defect which is alwaies naturall to us, and which is the proper <hi>French</hi> Temper; There's another Cauſe for which the greateſt part of men cannot conceal long a deſign, without giving it Air, nor retain unto themſelves a good Thought; 'Tis the ſmall power they have to reſiſt common reports, and th'opinions that run abroad. It hath alwaies been th'humour of the people to be the Cenſurers of the deſigns of Princes, and of the conduct of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors. 'Tis a diſeaſe which cannot be cured in them; And it ſeems to them, that after they have made them their ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, and have put their goods and lifes into their hands; that at leaſt the liberty is reſerved unto them of judging of their abilities; Strange folly, that they who make ſo ill and crooked Judgements in their own affairs, whereof th'extent is ſo ſhort, and th'intelligence ſo eaſie; conſtitute themſelves Arbiters of State-affairs, whoſe principall circumſtance is ſecrecy and which ought to be in th'eyes of the people, as propheſies, which are not to be underſtood but by their ſucceſs.</p>
                  <p>And nevertheleſs, though the knowledg of things be hid from them as much as may be, &amp; that the Cauſes are concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; they forbear not to pry into them, &amp; that they may have alwaies matter of diſturbance. And wherewith to torment themſelves unprofitably; They believe all things their ſenſe repreſents unto them, or that another paſſion ſuggeſts unto them. A dexterous perſon then, and one who hath a ſtrong underſtanding and high Courage; makes alwaies towards his End without diſturbance for theſe popular infirmities. He reſts in peace, whilſt they who have nothing to do, but
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:99746:36"/>to take their eaſe, and cheriſh their health, are in trouble and in a feavers, and imitates the Heavens which alter not their Courſe for the Tempeſts of th'Aire, nor for the noyſe that is made in that ſtormy Region. On the Contrary, weak un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings cannot ſuſtain the liberty of Judgements, nor th'indiſcretion of Tongues; The conjectures of Curious, and the ſpeculations of idle perſons offend them; They make haſte to give a reaſon of their Deſigns, and by a precipitated judgement which they paſſe upon them, they ſee them abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive or fatal.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sr. the Cardinal</hi> hath not done the like; When Envy was raiſed againſt him, when the Wits did mutiny againſt his Government; when his Enemies oppoſed him ſilently, or have aſſaulted him a outward force, or by publique Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; all that, hath not diſordered him. His Actions were neither ſlow nor confuſed: And, as if ſuch Difficulties im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved his Judgement, or gave him new Forces; He never appeared ſo intelligent, or ſo valiant, as in all occaſions that ſeemed to be deſperate. Whilſt th' <hi>Engliſh</hi> poſſeſſed th'Iland of <hi>Rhee,</hi> and that <hi>Languedoc</hi> was in Rebellion; and that one part oſ the <hi>Huguenots</hi> had declared themſelves, and th'others obſerved the ſucceſſe of forraine enterpriſes; That the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented Catholiques did rejoyce at th'ills of the <hi>State,</hi> and that others feared the future which they ſaw troubled and full of ſtorms; never perſon was more expoſed to complaints and ill language, then himſelfe. Indiſcretion was extream; Inſolency raiſed to threats, and that purple which in Venerable in th'eyes of Catholiques, and the Dignity of a Prince of the Church, were in danger of that common Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe, of being violated: His ſoul nevertheleſſe changed not its place; His Courage was not ſhaken; He did not uſe violent or faint Remedies, as had been ſometimes done to ſtay the Diſorder; He did not uſe hatefull preſervatives a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt an ill, which inflames by oppoſition, and is provoked by reſiſtance: He choſe rather to fight them with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Actions, than by the fear of his puniſhment; and reſolved that his Virtue ſhould confound th'Artifices of the wicked, and th'Errours of the ſimple.</p>
                  <p>But how many ſiniſter Judgements and ſharp diſcourſes, did the ſiege of <hi>Rochell</hi> raiſe? How many paſſions: did that Town-ſtir up amongſt the Proteſtants, and amongſt the Catholiques? How many Oppoſitions were ſet on foot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that Deſign, in the Kingdom and abroad, by them who were our declared Enemies, and by them who would ſeem to be our friends? What had not been ſaid of th'expence of that ſiege, if being ſo vaſt it had been unprofitable? How
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:99746:37"/>much had they cryed out againſt us, if we had ſuffered our Allies to periſh, and if that we had not reduced to obedience the rebellious <hi>French.</hi> And nevertheleſſe, ſo many different paſſions, and all thoſe irregular Motions, did not ſtop our purſuit, nor th'heat of an Enterpriſe, which hath ſecured the foundations of the State, and the foot of the Crown. And at that laſt buſineſſ of <hi>Italy,</hi> How many diſgracefull Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, and outragious Murmurings did it produce againſt the Reputation of that great Miniſter of State? It ſeemed that there were perſons hired in all places, of purpoſe to cry down his Actions; His Enemies had found th'occaſions they ſought for, to diſcharge their Malice with colour, and vomited their Hatred with liberty: The people that ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily wiſh ill to them that govern them, and ſuffer themſelves alwaies to be led by running Reports, eſpecially when they are bad, remember no more th'evill from which they were delivered, but demand the good which they could not ſo ſoon receive, and few perſons conſidered what was done, nor the progreſs of the Kings Armes, nor his Conqueſts, but what was yet to be done; Even our Allies applyed themſelves to us for repair of their Loſſes: And as if they could not be imprudent or unhappy in our Company; It ſeemed good to them that we ſhould anſwer for their faults, and for their diſgraces; and the worſt. Accident of all, was the ſickneſſe of the King, ſo very violent, that it gave no place for hopes to honeſt men, and in ſuch a conjuncture, that if this Prince had dyed, the world muſt have changed its face, and muſt have taken another Courſe, then what it ought to follow. In this Confuſion of Spirits, and of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, the Conſtancy of Sr. the <hi>Cardinall,</hi> loſt not it ſelfe; His Reaſon was ſtill awake, the Proviſions for the reliefe of <hi>Caſal,</hi> were not interrupted; and he made it appeare that the wiſe Man is above all paſſions; and the true griefe he ſuffered for the love of ſo great a Maſter, leſt him ſtrength and Addreſs enough not to let go the Helme, and to bring us to our Haven in ſpight of contrary winds.</p>

His Actions have deſerved Clappings from all hands, and praiſes from all Mouthes; They have given him dayes of Triumph, they have pierced the moſt retired parts of the World, and in all places there are but a few Names ſo great as his, after that of his Maſter; But he hath had his back blowes and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions; He hath not been exempted from private Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, and publique Vexations. Fortune and Envy have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſly exerciſed him; notwithſtanding, his Courage failed him not; his Conduct was equall. The Revolution that ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded him, made no change in him, and whatſoever hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, his ſoul was neither puffed nor abated; this equality nevertheleſſe is not ordinarily found. And as amongſt the brighteſt Colours, there are but a few that preſerve the ſame
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:99746:38"/>luſtre, and the ſame apperance to the light of a Day, and to the light of Torches: Hiſtories have alſo furniſhed us but with a few examples of Illuſtrious perſons, who have been equall in Proſperity and Adverſity: <hi>Spain</hi> commends the conſtancy of the <hi>Duke of Alva,</hi> and that he was never ſo great as in his afflictions. But it confeſſeth alſo, that proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity made him overflow; that he was inſolent when he was proſperous; and that the Victories he gained were odious to his Maſters, though they were profitable unto them.</p>
                  <p>On the contrary, let us conſider the three Princes of <hi>Spain,</hi> that have known how to raign for an Age and halfe, and have dared to introduce immortall Deſignes, in a form of Government where Soveraigns dye, and which changeth often their Maſter: Lets conſider, I ſay, <hi>Ferdinand, Charles</hi> the fifth, <hi>Philip</hi> the ſecond, and we ſhall find that all their lives have been nothing but a Compoſition of good and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, and a confuſion of contrary things. We ſhall there ſee Proſperity without Number, Diſgraces without Meaſures; Wounds dreſſed with Laurels, Triumphs adorned with Mourning, and above all that, conſtant and firm Courages, and an immoveable Virtue.</p>
                  <p>Behold <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> glorious in the reduction of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Granada,</hi> and with the Title of Catholique; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him triumphant in the Conqueſt of <hi>Naples,</hi> and of the fortune of <hi>France.</hi> Behold that a fancy gives him <hi>Navarre,</hi> and that chance finds him an unknown world and new wealth. This neither enflames him, nor effeminates him; He is not the more lazy, nor the leſſe vigilant; He formes: greater deſigns, and layes the Platform of a Monarch which ſhall exerciſe his Nephews a long time, and trouble the reſt of other Nations, and the peace of the world. Moreover, lets contemplate thill ſuceſſe of his life, and th'other ſide of the Medall. We ſhall ſee a Prince ill handled by fortune, and a Diadem bruiſed by her ſtrokes. We ſhall ſee a Father bury his own Son, and make Funeralls for his eldeſt Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: A Husband that loſeth his Wife, who was his Glory; and had been more the Companion of his troubles than of his bed; A Maſter aban doned by his Servants and Creatures, an old Man forced from his Houſe, and a Father in law ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped his own Son in Law. In this Sea of Diſgraces and of Afflictions, we ſhall alſo ſee an admirable ſerenity of ſpirit. A Calm that overthrows not it ſelfe; or if there was ſome kind of emotion, it did not paſs into a ſtorm, and was not vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent not dangerous. 'Tis true, that his Courage had a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in it which I cannot conceal, and a fault too viſible to be diſſembled; which is, not to have been able to ſuffer the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:99746:38"/>reputation of he great Captain, not the Virtue of his own Subject that was faithful unto him. As to his Nephew <hi>Charles,</hi> 'tis certain that he was never ſo tractable as in proſperity, not ſo inflexible in Adverſity. He never yeeled to force; no Prince of his time gave ſo much, and loſt ſo little; and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſay that the never broke his word, but t'exerciſe Clemency, and to pardon his Enemies, whoſe Ruine he had ſworn: During the tempeſt that aroſe in the Haven of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giers</hi> againſt his Fleet, and when the Heavens deſtroyed it in his ſight, no other word every went out of his Mouth, than that wherewith our Saviour <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath taught us to pray, <hi>That thy will be done.</hi> He was humbled, but not overcome by that diſgrace, and in that terrible <hi>Chaos,</hi> where th'Elements were confounded, and Nature in diſorder, His Courage ſtood firm, His Judgement loſt not its Light: and he gave order for the embarking of his Troops, which were not periſhed, with the ſame liberty of ſoul as before he had done, when he returned Triumphant from the taking of <hi>Th<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>nis,</hi> and from the ſpoils of <hi>Africa.</hi> The life of <hi>Philip</hi> is a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble much mixed, and a repreſentation of divers former, and contrary Adventures; On the one ſide are ſeen Countries gained or recovered; the Springs of Gold and Silver diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered; Victory obtained againſt <hi>Christians,</hi> and Infidels, and that incomparable Advantage to govern peaceably, from th'Eſcuriall, a part of two worlds, and to be feared in the middle of this Cabinet, from one end of th'Earth to th'other. But lets turn our ſight a little, and we ſhall find that this proſperity had frequent and long Eclipſes, and that the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of the Pictures exceeded the lively Colours. We ſhall encounter the Death of four wives which he tenderly loved: The fancies of his eldeſt Son which gave him ſo much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and forced him to put off the reſentmen of a Father, to execute th'office of a King, and function of a Judge: The jealouſies which the good ſucceſſe and great virtue of <hi>Don John of Austria</hi> gave him. The defeat of his Ships by Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts, and by Enemies; The Rebellion of the Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries which have deſerted <hi>Spain,</hi> and made poor the <hi>Indies.</hi> And amongſt all that, and in the midſt of that Revolution. and that confuſion of Accidents, not to wander, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve his Conſtancy; It muſt be acknowledged, that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to ſuch perſons by all ſorts of Rights, to govern the People, to the Superiours on Earth, and ſoveraign Arbiters of the deſtiny of men. Amidſt ſo many good ſucceſſes and rude experiences, where in the virtue of <hi>Philip</hi> was not loſt, I have made choice of a very remarkable Example; 'Tis of them that enter in proſperity, and be in the favours of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:99746:39"/>and th'evidences of Love which ſhe giveth. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis the fairer that 'tis ſo rare, and that 'tis more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult not to be overcome by pleaſure, than to reſiſt force, and to prevent bending than breaking. And as a gentle and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate heat penetrates our bodies eaſier than the cold, becauſe they expatiate themſelves to receive it, and cloze to repell the cold. So th'Allurements of proſperity are more active, and enter ſooner into the ſoul, which by deſire, and the hope of enjoyment, goes to meet them, than by th'at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of ill fortune, againſt which the ſoul fortifies her ſelfe, and defends all 'th Avenues by which ſhe might aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault it. After then that the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> had gained the battel of <hi>Lepantha,</hi> and that God had them that memorable Victory, the price whereof was loſt by their ill Conduct; He that carried the news to <hi>Philip,</hi> was ſo tranſported above himſelfe, and ſeized upon by ſo ſtrange an emotion, that with great difficulty could he make the report of it. On the contrary, <hi>Philip</hi> ſtood as cold as if it had nnot concerned him, and ſo little moved, as if the news had been indifferent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. He replyed onely with a ſerious Face, and ſettled Countenance, <hi>THAT</hi> DON JOHN <hi>HAD MUCH HAZ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ARDED.</hi> From what cauſe ſoever this coldneſſe proceeded, either from a ſpirit abated by a long Apprehenſion, leaſt the battel ſhould be loſt, or from a ſoul prepared for all ſorts of chances, and for all the Accidents of life; or elſe from a Conſideration which ſuffered him not to rejoyce at the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of an Action, whoſe principles it may be he did not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem reaſonable enough.</p>
                  <p>From that cauſe ſoever, I ſay, it proceeded; the view is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes fair, and the ſubſtance very noble. And I am no more aſtoniſhed, if the perſon, who was not tranſported for a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, which delivered <hi>Italy</hi> from an approaching Ruine, and all <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> from a great fear; received ſince with any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent. Tranquillity or true Conſtancy, the newes of the Routing of the Fleet, which had coſt him ſo much money, and ought to have tyed <hi>England</hi> to the Chain, and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelfe to ſay, <hi>That he had not ſent his Fleet to fight againſt the Winds.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The conſtancy of Miniſters of State, hath this advantage over that of Soveraigns, That the Soveraigns are alwaies pittied in their ill ſucceſſe, though it happen by their fault; and that Love or Reſpect which the people bears them, doth diſcharge them from th'envy of the Loſſes which they make by their imprudency. On the contrary, they caſt upon the Miniſters of State, all th'evill of the State, though they are not guilty. The require from them a continuall felicitie,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:99746:39"/>though it be not in their power. They will have them ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity for all the chances, though they ought onely to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure their Counſels. They make them inſtruments of all their afflictions, and of all their ſufferings, though ordinarily their ſins are the cauſe. In briefe, they handle them in the ſame manner, and with the ſame injuſtice as the firſt <hi>Chriſtians</hi> were handled by the <hi>Pagans,</hi> who took exceptions to them for th'anger of Heaven, and for the wounds of th'Empire, and made them th'Authors fo th'Inundations, and of the ſterili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and of the plagues, wherewith the Nation was grieved Truly, <hi>Sr. the Cardinal</hi> hath alwaies acted in ſuch manner, that what Countenance ſoever th'Affaires have taken, and whatſoever traverſes the time hath raiſed, he was never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhed nor caſt down; He abated nothing of his purſuit; He continually reſpected the Dignity of the Maſter he ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and the reputation of the Crown which he laboured to ſuſtain. And whatſoever happened unto him, &amp; how ſtrange ſoever the Tempeſt was, he reſolved, to periſh with the Government in his hand, and to be able to ſay, what <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt wrote to his Mother, after the loſs of the Journey to <hi>Pavia; All is except th'Honour.</hi> But this Courage which hath ſhined ſo eminently in Diſgraces, was not effeminated in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerity, and that magnanimity which he expreſſed in his ill fortune, when it undertook to exerciſe him, changed it ſelfe into an excellent Moderation, and into a moſt perfect acknowledgement of that which proceeded from th'hand of God, and from the fortune of a Prince.</p>

                  <head type="sub">That the Science to diſcover the merits of Men, and t'employ them, is neceſſary for a Miniſter of State.</head>
                  <p>ONe of the Nobleſt Conditions which formes the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of State, and the perfection of Adminiſtration is the Science to diſcern other men, and th'Art to employ them: Truly, as our ſoul, how heavenly ſoever it is and all ſpirituall, hath need of the Body to make its operations: And as God makes uſes of ſecond Cauſes, to govern with them the World, and to renue Nature; ſo a Miniſter of State, how excellent ſoever he may be, hath neceſſary uſe of a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of perſons, to labour with him, and to help him to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry th'Engine of the State, and burthen of Affairs. 'Tis the Pilot that ought to give Motion to all other Officers in the Ship. 'Tis th'head that ought to put in exerciſe th'Armes, and th'other parts of the Body; And as that ancient Captain
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:99746:40"/>found no Title ſo glorious, nor Argument more magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent to make himſelfe known, than to anſwer him who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of him. If he was a man of compleat Arms, or an Archer, or a light Horſeman; <hi>That he was the perſon that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded all thoſe men there.</hi> So a principall Miniſter of State, ought to have a ſpirit, ſuperiour to other Officers of State, and not to be ignorant of the Duties of Generals of Armies, nor of the Duties of Judges, nor of them who manage the Treaſury. This Condition is remarkable in <hi>Sr. the Cardinal;</hi> and 'tis true, if a man have but one good Quality, he knows how to make choice of it in the midſt of many defects, and to diſcern a Grain of Gold in the midſt of Gravel and Dung. The Earth is not more various in its proprieties, nor the Heaven in its influences, than men are in their Tempers and Inclinations. And 'tis an extraordinary thing to find a ſoul capable of all ſorts of good, or a Temper proper for all the functions of the ſoul; Lets place here ſome few of its Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, and of its Proprieties, for the clearing of our ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. They in whom Imagination is predominant, and who have ſubtil &amp; hot ſpirits, are very proper for th'<hi>Intrigue.</hi> They are Rich in expedients, and have preſent Apprehenſions which warrant them from ſurpriſes, which ſuffer them not to be confounded, and which reſiſt the firſt impreſſion of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents which have not been foreſeeen; and the newneſs of Occurrences. They ſpeak ordinarily with grace, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs themſelves with facility. Their Action hath ſomewhat, I know not what, that pleaſeth, and a certain Harmony which charmes the ſenſes, and glides even Reaſon, and to th'Affections of the ſoul; They are bold to undertake, and for that Difficulties appear leſſe to them then they are, or beneath their ſtrength; They caſt themſelves blindly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them; they precipitate in ſtead of walking; And if they meet with a Ditch in the way, it ſtops them not; either they fall in, or leap over it. They are pleaſed with Noyſe, and love Diſturbance; they appear ſtrong in troubled times, and the Conſuſion of Affaires is their element, and the matter which is proper for them. They do ſometimes great things; and 'tis not poſſible that undertaking much, all ſhould ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed ill. That they encounter onely, if they fail in their choice, Hazard, where th'Election is of no uſe to them, and that being ſo ſeldom wiſe, they are never happy; They are nevertheleſſe of great ſervice, and of incredible proſit, when they fall under the Direction of a wiſe man, who tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers th'heat by his judgement, and moderates their impetuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity by his Prudence. And as Philoſophy obſerves, That Choller ſerves for a ſpur to Virtue, and puts life to it: 'Tis
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:99746:40"/>alſo true, that when theſe active humours are accompanied with a good Senſe, and perfect Reaſon, nothing ſeems diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult or impoſſible to them; But alſo when they are Maſters of their Actions, and Arbiters of Affaires; their Conduct is much to be feared: It is more dangerous then profitable; They cannot commit eaſie faults, having alwaies great deſignes in their heads, and they ſeldom fail of making them, having not circumſpection enough, or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight to avoid them. They that are of a cold temper, and in whom reaſon abounds, are more fit to govern. And though their Actions are not ſo glaring and tumultuous as th'others are, yet they are more lively and more efficacious; The common people, who have no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding but for th'objects of ſenſe, and comprehends but what it ſees, and what it toucheth, admires theſe leſſe then the former perſons. They are nevertheleſſe of a higher price in the judgement of wiſe men; and have the ſame Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of them, th'Architects have of Maſons; that Pilots have of Mariners; and that they who draw the deſigns of Pictures, have of them who know onely how to mingle their Colours, and to habit the Figures? They ſeldom contribute to the fall of States by Imprudency; in ſo much that the firſt Law they obſerve, is, to commit no faults. As the firſt Inclination which Nature gives us, is to ſhun th'Evill, and what is contrary to us. They ſeldom ſhipwrack, becauſe they know the nature of the Seas, and of the Winds; That they know how to foreſee the Tempeſts, and that they put out in time, and gain timely the Haven; They are fit for War and Peace; they are good to gain, and to preſerve: their Virtue is ever preſent, and there's neither condition of time, nor exception of affaires that hinders them to act, or renders them unprofitable. There are others in whom Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination may find heat enough to act, if there were drineſs enough, and if it were not drowned in the Flegme, and in an abundance of moyſture which duls and cooles it. And ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe they have not the vivacity of the firſt, nor the prudence of the ſecond. I ſpeak of that high and divine Virtue which reſides in the underſtanding, and in that ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Region of the ſoul, which is the Guide and Torch of other Virtues, and which chooſeth the means of things that are feiſable; for as to the reſt, they have but an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and diminutive virtue, which is as the Shadow, and a light impreſſion of the true; if <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> muſt be believed: Their principall ſtudy is to hide their defects, to daube the breaches which they cannot make up; to paint the face, and to deceive the world with apparances of Good, and by po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:99746:41"/>Virtues. But in ſo much that'tis hard to appear a long time what a man is not, and that a lame perſon counterfeits to little purpoſe, when he cannot walk far, but he will be obſerved; ſo th'Art of theſe men is eaſily diſcovered, and a little Converſation undreſſeth that borrowed perſon, and that Stage-Player; when they are in Imployments, they are ſecret t'exceſſe. They keep ſilence not by diſcretion, but by feare; and in ſo much that they cannot diſtinguiſh betwixt the things they ought to conceal, and ſuch as ought to be publiſhed; They ſuppreſſe all, and ſo betray ſometimes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocently th'honours of their Maſter, and the Reputation of his Affairs. they bring ſome deſign and ſubtilty to all they do, which is that petty and imperfect Prudence, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as I have ſaid, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> makes mention. But had he been of our time, he had alſo knowm that as the Alchymiſts being unable to make perfect the Mettals that are not, change them that are, and thereof make falſe Money: ſo alſo it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens that theſe ſubtill perſons being not able to conduct their little Artifices, and the diſpoſition they have to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty, even to the true Prudence; change it into Jugling, and make an Art of it, which is the ſlime of humane ſociety, and the poyſon of Commerce. They have nevertheleſſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſomewhat of good, and were not made by chance; Heaven hath caſt ſome favourable aſpect upon them, and they are capable to ſerve, if they are imployed according to their Forces. If they are not good to deliberate and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve, they are good for th'execution of ſuch Orders as are preſcribed them; They want not confidence to act, nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſancy t'inſinuate into the ſpirits of them, with whom they treat. They are exact to perform their charge, they ſhun not labour; and though the ſoftneſſe of their Complexion withdraws them from it; their duty nevertheleſſe whereof they uſually have care, and the vanity whereof they are ever ſick, preſſe them to it, and maintain them in it: That is alſo the cauſe that they are not very wicked; That they are not capable of great Vices, no more then of great Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues. And, if th'Example doth not Corrupt them, or ſome violent occaſion tranſport them. That they will never be guilty of thoſe black Actions which ſtain th'Honour, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Conſcience.</p>
                  <p>There's a fourth kind of Men, who have the ſoul heavier then all th'others, and in whoſe Compoſition Nature hath laid up more of Earth. Theſe men are capable of great paines and long patience; they never yeeld to labour; they never work but to work; they know not what belongs to honeſt leiſure. And that reſt which is th'end of th'active
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:99746:41"/>Life, and which the Philoſophers ſeek for to be happy, is their torment and miſery. They are unapt for Negotiation: But in ſo much that in the midſt of that Maſs whereof they are compounded, they have ſome beam of good ſenſe; and although their Underſtanding makes no flame, it hath never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe ſome ſort of clearneſſe; they are not to be deſpiſed; they are not improper for the <hi>Oeconomy:</hi> They may ſerve in an Army to preſſe on labour; to make proviſions for Victuals, and for the like ſervices, wherein the Body hath a greater ſhare then th'Underſtanding, but that they have need of both.</p>

                  <head type="sub">Of a fifth Temper, which comprehends the perfections of all th'others.</head>
                  <p>TO conclude, There's a fifth Order of Conſtitutions, which a few perſons enter into, and which the world ſees ſeldomer than Miracles: For this, Nature opens all her Treaſures, becomes prodigall of her graces, draws forth her Art, and goes to the very bottom of her power; And as the ordinary Conſtitutions are formed of the ſubſtance of the Elements, and of the hidden virtues of Heaven, which are mingled with Harmony and Symmetry: It ſeems that theſe are compoſed of what others have of moſt rare and pure; that they are Extracts and Elixirs; and that the bodies which are ſo furniſhed, are not Priſons for the ſoul, but very commodious Palaces; nor rebellious ſlaves, but tracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Servants, or obedient Subjects. In effect, As th'Heavens have generall Qualities, and which agree, and enter into ſociety with all the qualities of th'Elements, and of the Bodies which they produced; In like manner thoſe divine Conſtitutions whereof we ſpeak, are proper to all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of the ſoul, and for all the operations of thoſe facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; There's nothing in them of malignant, nor any thing that hinders; Th'abundance of the memory makes not the judgement poore: th'Action of th'underſtanding doth not leſſen the benefits of the Memory, and diſſolves not its Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations; Memory and Judgement take not from the Underſtanding its edge, its vivacity, nor its preſence; All workſ there with facility; and that which cauſeth diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance and trouble in other bodies, produceth here a miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Harmony and perfect Intelligence. Th'underſtanding, as it hath been ſaid, is ſo much Maſter of the body, that it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyes it without reſiſtance. 'Tis ſupple to all its deſires, takes
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:99746:42"/>pains as if it were ſtrong, though it be ſometimes ſick and weak; and as if it were born up by th'others ſtrength, or raiſed by its Agility; It holds the body to all ſorts of toyl, and is not over come by the greatneſs of the labour or conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of it.</p>
                  <p>The ſenſitive Appetite is there very quiet; no Motion al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt doth there ariſe, which is not voluntary either in its birth or duration. The Deſire of glory is the ſole paſſion which makes its ſelfe violently to be felt; and which is ſo imperious, if it be not ſuppreſſed, that it confounds or makes all th'others ſubject unto it, when it is without bridle; 'tis not content to raign over the lower part of the Soul, it will domineer in th'higheſt: She will command Reaſon; ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares that it belongs to her to violate Juſtice with praiſe; She ſtirs up Uſurpators and Robbers of Provinces and Kingdoms; whom ſhe cauſeth to be called Conquerors: ſhe commands the Title of Great to be given <hi>Alexander,</hi> for having unjuſtly poſſeſſed himſelſe of part of the world, and he had a will to have invaded th'other part of it; She cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, that even to Chriſtians, th'Emperours Honour them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their qualities, with the Name of a perſon that hath raiſed th'Empire, to which they ſucceed upon the Ruines of their Country. In briefe, it cauſeth that one is called the <hi>Flayl</hi> of God to colour his Invaſions, and another the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector of Princes, and of the Nations of th'Earth. But when the deſire of glory is ſubmitted to Reaſon; when the Soul loves it without being tranſported; when ſhe takes it not for the end of Virtue, but for the purſuit of it, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth to it ſelfe a ſecond Glory, which is more certain than what Fortune doth diſtribute, and than th'opinion which Men give; There's not a paſſion in the world ſo fair, nor more profitable: She takes away the taſts of all others that are baſe or effeminate: She acquires Imitators of Virtue, and by the preſent or near approaching Recompence which ſhe offers her, renders her more fertile, and more efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, The Conſtitution whereof we ſpeak, ſends marks of its Nobility, even to th'outſide, and to th'exteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, of Men; It imprints there certain Characters, which make him to be reverenced of them, that ſee him. It covers his face with Majeſty; it puts into his eyes a fire, which is more bright than that of ordinary eyes; and gives him, in a word, ſome beam of that Beauty whereof <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe hath not refuſed the praiſe; and which, by the means of the ſenſes, makes a ſuddain impreſſion upon the will, and gains, before Diſcourſe be entertained, and reaſon perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:99746:42"/>
                  <p> I will not ſpeak here of the Conſtitution of <hi>Sr. the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall,</hi> nor of a Good which he hath not done to himſelfe, but received it from th'Indulgence of Heaven, and from the Cares of Nature. There are truths which would not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies be publiſhed; And this ſeaſon would hardly permit them in his favour, the knowledge whereof depends upon ſo profound and delicate ſpeculation, ſince ſhe is ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous enough to Conteſt with him th'Experience of ſenſes, or to change the face of things which we have touched or ſeen. I ſuppreſs then my Judgement in this ſubject, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate my ſelf to the time, and to th'Inclination which raigneth. I will onely ſay in Generall, that as there are Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, which are to be diſcovered by th'encounter of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Symptoms; and as, for the diſcovery of Gold which is in th'Earth, there are many ſigns which ought to appear above ground, &amp; in the Superficies; ſo you muſt conclude this high &amp; divine Compoſition, whereof I ſpeak, by a multitude of great Actions of divers Kinds, &amp; of different Condition, which the ſame ſubject hath produced. Let reflection now be made, if there be a mind for it, upon the life of <hi>Sr.the Cardinal.</hi> Let paſt Governments be compared with his; let it be examined, what the King hath acted ſince he had him for his Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; Let the Greatneſſe, the Variety, and the number of things which have been done, be conſidered: Let the ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the time be obſerved, which ſhuts up all theſe won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and which amazeth th'Imagination of them who have ſeen them, and will weaken for the future the faith of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory; And after that, let every perſon judge of the Matter propoſed, according to his ſenſe or paſſion; and let him make himſelfe voluntarily blind; If he be afraid to behold a Light that offends him, and a Truth that angers him. I will not forbear t'obſerve, that although <hi>Sr. the Cardinal</hi> in acting, gives ſomewhat t'Honour; That he is very ſenſible of the Glory of faire Actions, and is not exempt from a ſenſe which all generous ſouls partake of; That, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, hath never changed his Duty, never did wrong to his Conſcience, and to the Counſells which he hath propoſed. He hath not onely conſidered the Juſtice of things, but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times proceeded to Charity, which is ſo ſeldom called to the Councills of Princes, and which makes with Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency, the two extreams betwixt which, Reaſon of State is ſhut up. This hath been ſeen particularly in the Conduct which the <hi>King</hi> obſerved towards th'<hi>Emperour,</hi> and the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> before he began the War of <hi>Italy</hi> and had renewed it: but I will ſpeak thereof in another place.</p>
                  <p>I return to the firſt ſubject of the precedent Diſcourſe,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:99746:43"/>and to make it appear, that <hi>Sr. the Cardinall</hi> in a ſoveraign degree hath the ſpirit of Diſcerning, whereof I have above ſpoken; I will fix upon ſome Elections which have been made ſince he was in the Government.</p>
                  <p>No perſon is ignorant of th'Eminency, and of the weight of the Charge of the <hi>Keeper of the Seals.</hi> 'Tis one of the nobleſt parts of the Body of the State: 'Tis the generall form of the Juſtice of the Kingdom; 'tis an univerſal Cauſe whoſe Influence is not Circumſcribed, which penetrates within and without; which makes its power known near and far, and operates in all places where we have Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication or power. And 'tis of Importance that they who poſſeſs it, deſerve it; and that they who exerciſe it, fill it up. And 'tis true, that for that Dignity, the Kings choice could not fix upon a perſon worthier then that of <hi>Sr. of Chaſteauneuf;</hi> I ſpeak not of the ſplendour of the Family from which he is come, nor of the faculty it hath had to this day, to give Illuſtrious perſons to the ſtate; They are Accidents which are not Proprietics, and Conditions which may fail in Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies. And though the ſeeds of good, grow ordinarily with good blood, 'Tis not to be ſaid that they ought alwaies to fructifie: And though the Spring be very pure, it follows not but the Stream may be poyſoned, or become troubled, and taſte of th'ill Qualities of the places it hath paſſed. Theſe Advantages then of birth, and priviledges of fortune, are but incitements to do well by th'Examples of their Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors: To render the good the fairer, which they encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and to make the Counterpoyſe in a promotion betwixt two equall Virtues. But for <hi>Sr. of Chaſteauneuf,</hi> he hath no need of the Lights of his Anceſtors to make himſelfe ſeen. He is ſufficiently obſervable in himſelf; beſides the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge he hath gained. He hath highly that which Nature gives, which is the good ſenſe; He hath watched in Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments and Negotiations. He knows our affairs, and the affairs of Strangers: He is neither weak nor intereſſed: His virtue is without Artifice, and th'evill which repreſents it ſelfe publiquely, or that cometh more dangerouſly under the vizard of good, and with its Liveries, is not capable to deceive or corrupt him: wherefore he hath received no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what was due to his Services, or to his Merit, and therein the choice of the King hath but followed the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique deſires, and the Predictions have been made even from a former Raign. And when it was in Queſtion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve th'Iſland of <hi>Rhe,</hi> and to uphold <hi>France</hi> ready to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to precipice, there was need of a man that deſpiſed Death, and dared to caſt himſelfe on a manifeſt danger; who had
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:99746:43"/>enough of affection to be willing to periſh for his Maſter, and prudence enough to manage the leaſt Beam of ſafety that ſhould appear, and the higheſt Apparance for good to be ſeen in a deplorable Occaſion. But whom could <hi>Sr. the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall</hi> propoſe, or the King chooſe, that was more capable for that purpoſe, then <hi>Sr. of Chombert?</hi> ſo th'Event did not deceive th'opinon had of the Virtue of ſo great a perſon, Th'End of that enterpriſe exceeded all that could have been deſired of good ſucceſs; Our friends were delivered, and the Rout of our Enemies compleated the Victory, which we ſought not but in their retract. After the firſt paſſage of <hi>Suza,</hi> could <hi>Montferrat</hi> be truſted, in ſurer or more eſteemed hands, then thoſe of <hi>Sr. of Thorax?</hi> And again, as fortune had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prepared him that Occaſion, and reſerved him for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of <hi>Caſal,</hi> and to confirm th'Honour he hath gained in <hi>Rhe;</hi> It ſeeems alſo, that by a certain fatality, <hi>Sr. of Chom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> had been deſtined to go to relieve him the ſecond time, and to compleat the Glory of that Siege by the ſafety of that place. In thoſe laſt Emotions of <hi>Italy,</hi> did not the King ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear admirable, in the choice of the men which he imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there? And though Policy permits not many Chiefs of equall Authority in an Army, He underſtood nevertheleſſe ſo well to diſcern the juſt proportion of their humours, and the neceſſary Temper to conſerve Concord amongſt them, that he joyned and changed them to ſo good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that, it may be, his ſervice was advanced by that plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, and his Armies were the more happy.</p>
                  <p>And when the paſſage was to be opened for our Troops, for the Reliefe of <hi>Caſal,</hi> and the reſiſtance of Armies to be forced which oppoſed it; To whom could that deſign be more rationally committed,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Monſieur</hi> Mount Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raney.</note> than to them who have execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it? What might not be expected from that Lord, who came into the world, lighted with the virtue of his Anceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and Crowned with their Glory? who laboured ſo much to improve that immortall Inheritance; who is not ſo abſolute in th'Armies he commands by his Authority, as by th'Affections of the Men of War; That Love makes more men follow him in perillous occaſions then Duty; who ſhews to others the way of doing well, and whoſe exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple would inſpire the ſtrongeſt paſſions into the moſt fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſouls. <hi>Veillane</hi> and <hi>Carignan</hi> ſhall be for ever famous by th'effects of their Valour, and by that of th'other Marſhal,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Monſieur</hi> Feat.</note> who accompanied them with his Courage and Prudence; and made himſelfe to be no leſſe conſiderable in War than in Peace, nor in the Field than in the Cabinet; Above all, 'tis a thing worthy of Conſideration, and a particular mark
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:99746:44"/>of the Kings judgement, and of the wiſdom of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill, in leaving the Marſhall of Force conſtantly in <hi>Italy,</hi> and in making that Army as the foundation of our Armies in that Country, and him the Director of the War.</p>
                  <p>Age which ruines th'Active Qualities of ſo many other perſons, offended not his; old Age, which chils the blood, did not diminiſh his Valour. 'Tis a habit, which had not in him its Original from th'heats of the Body, but in the lights of Reaſon; and he was as bold when there was cauſe, as he was ever wiſe. His long and ancient experience, and the good ſenſe wherein he naturally abounded, permitted him not to commit any fault; He knew the <hi>Spaniards</hi> too well to fall into their ſnares, and into a ſurpriſe by their Deceits, and with the Companions which the King gave him. There was nothing to be feared, and all good ſucceſſe was to be hoped from his Conduct.</p>
                  <p>It muſt not be forgot, that <hi>Sr. the Cardinal,</hi> conſiders not onely Merit in the choice of them whom he propoſeth, but would alſo have good Birth, if it be poſſible; That things may be acted with Glory, and that the reputation of affairs might improve by the Dignity of the Perſons who manage them. He is very far from th'humour of a certain King, who made his Phyſicism his principall Counſellor: And from the humour of another, who made his Chirurgion enter into the Councill of State, and permitted the ſame hands to handle the Seals, which had newly quitted the Razour and Laun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet; wherefore the Nobility is more imployed in Negoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations then heretofore it was. They who lead Armies, or help to make War are called to manage Treaties of Peace, and the ſuſpenſions of Arms; And 'tis true, that ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily th'affairs do proſper well in their hands, becauſe they are uſually bolder in Action, and have the ſenſe, leſſe ſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticated, than perſons of the long Robe.</p>

                  <p>THere's nothing ſo univerſall in the world, as Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, and it ſeems that God hath affected it, to ſhew his power by it, and to render Nature fair. The number of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, as 'tis ſaid, ſurpaſſeth the number of other Creatures. But if the Schools would have believed <hi>St. Thomas,</hi> the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of kinds which is amongſt them, had equalled the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:99746:44"/>number of particulars, and there had not been in thoſe high and divine Hierarchies two Natures alike; However inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that they conceived that the Dignity of the living Creatures encreaſed by the multitude of th'Individuals, which compoſed them; and that <hi>Philoſophy</hi> hath ſent back the <hi>Phoenix</hi> to the fables of the Poets, who have ſung of him as being alone, The greateſt part of the Schools have departed in that ſenſe from the judgement of that Doctor, whoſe opinions are ſo often adored by them. Let's go on: The Varieties of bodies which iſſue from th'Elements were incredible, if Nature had not ſubmitted them to our ſenſe; and if Art did not diſcover unto us an infinity of Words, which are made of a few Letters; and an infinity of Figures, which are drawn out of a ſmall quantity of Colours; And an infinity of Colours, which are taken out of a ſmall quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Drugs. This is not all; The diveſity which Nature could not place in Eſſences, ſhe hath put to the forms which accompany them; what ſhe could not do to the principal, ſhe hath done to the Incidents and Acceſſaries; and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity which is in the faces of men, for to diſtinguiſh them from Beaſts, is changed by many Marks of diſſemblance, for to diſtinguiſh them from one another. This Second Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity proceeds from the firſt mixture of th'Elements, which enters into the Compoſition of the Bodies, from the virtue of Heaven, and of the Stars which are therein pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant, and from the quality of the Climate, and of the place which have a great ſhare in the Compoſition, and in the Conſtitution of all things that are born.</p>
                  <p>That if the Compoſitions of bodies of the ſame kind, are ſo divers for the Cauſes above mentioned; How much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ought the Difference to be, which is found in the manners of men, where th'Inclinations of the Body do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terveyn, the motions of Reaſon. Examples from without, and ſtrange ſuggeſtions; but above all th'Inclinations of the Body prevail, and the ſtrength of the Conſtitution: Reaſon is very ſeldom heard, Men live almoſt wholly by paſſion, and as if the whole Man were but a lump, the greateſt part of them act, but according to that party, and chuſe rather to ſubmit unto it, to be at reſt, if they can, then to have War in reſiſting it; and incline rather to peace by ſervitude than by Victory. Inſomuch that a Miniſter of State ought ot take great care not to act by Imitation; not to frame his Conduct by th'Example of ſtrangers, not to follow remote Idaea's, and not to ſuffer himſelfe to be couſe<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:99746:45"/>of <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> handle in a different manner the Diſeaſes of thoſe Countries; If the Morall have not an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act and indiviſible Medium for the virtue it teacheth. If the Church for faſtings and abſtinencies, be leſſe Indulgent in relation to the people of the Eaſt, than of the North; And if all proceeds from the inequality of Complexions, which ariſeth in part from the difference of Climates, and places. Why ſhould not the ſame Conſiderations be received in the Conducts of States; where not onely the Conſtitutions of men are unlike, and their manners contrary; but their foundations are different, and their policy diverſe; And where the Conteſt brought to maintain them is the more ardent, becauſe 'tis raiſed under the pretence of generall good, and is upheld by the multitude of them who are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terreſſed, and from publique force.</p>
                  <p>Lets come t'Examples; The ſeverity which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> affect, and which is conformable to their Conſtitution, is neceſſary for <hi>Spain;</hi> and thoſe Melancholick and glorious Spirits, are more ſtirred up then the ſpirits of others, by the ſhame of puniſhments, and by the hope of rewards. Their Inquiſition which appears ſo dreadfull, and which is ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable to all other Nations; it one of the principall cauſes of the peace which they enjoy, and of that high tranquilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty wherein they repoſe themſelves. Errour dares not open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear there: There's no contagion for their ſpirits; and if there be any remainder of <hi>Mahometiſm,</hi> after the forcing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of ſo many thouſands of <hi>Moores,</hi> it lies concealed in their hearts, or paſſeth not out of Caves and Darkneſs. They ſerve not onely againſt Infidelity, and for ſecurity of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences. Many Crimes purely civill, which cannot be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed according to ordinary formes, are ſent thither, and ſometimes innocent perſons are there expoſed; who are to be made Examples for th'Intereſt of the State, and to ſave th'honour of the Prince.

                  <p>But when they undertook to ſettle in other places that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Inquiſition, 'twas then that the ſpirits of the people Mutined; That Tempeſts have been ſeen t'ariſe; and that they have run to violent Remedies to hinder them. Hereſie
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:99746:45"/>entered into <hi>Flanders</hi> under <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, and Religion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be altered there, by the Trade with <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Germany, Graniuelle,</hi> who commanded there, repaired to the Inquiſition, to ſmoother an evil that ſeemed weak, becauſe it was new, and began onely to ſhew it ſelfe, and to bud. But he ſpoiled all with that Remedy: and whether he was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by a good zeal, as is probable; or with a deſire to ceaze on the Goods of the diſcovered perſons as he was accuſed; He cauſed ſo many to dye, and provoked ſo many other perſons, that th'Emperour was conſtrained to ſuppreſs that purſuit. The ſeeds nevertheleſs of the Diſeaſe dyed not, though they were laid aſleep,: The'Ulcer was concealed, but not healed, and a part of the people paſſed ſince from Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to Revolt, which they have changed with the time into a lawfull Dominion. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> believed alſo, that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition after their manner, would ſecure the Conqueſt of <hi>Naples;</hi> That it ſhould ſerve as a Bridle for that untamed Horſe; That it would hold that changeable and unſtable people under the yoak, and abate the higheſt heads of that Kingdom, who loved naturally diſorders; but they were deceived. And ſo ſoon, as <hi>Don Pedro of Toledo</hi> attempted it, <hi>Naples</hi> rebelled, and the people took Arms as for their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Liberty: and if th'Emperour had not taken away that Deſign; and if the <hi>Pope</hi> ſhould have conſented to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſalls of <hi>Cardinal Caraffe,</hi> they had hazarded the loſſe of that State, and what they had in <hi>Italy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So ſoon as <hi>Philip</hi> the ſecond war returned from <hi>Flanders</hi> into <hi>Spain,</hi> he ſent divers Heretiques to be puniſhed: He par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned neither Sex or Quality; He cauſed the Effigies of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine Pontius,</hi> the laſt Confeſſor of his Father to be burnt: He Commanded <hi>Bartholme,</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Toledo,</hi> to be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted; This Proceeding aſtoniſhed all the world; And if that Prince did not ſpare the memory of him, who held in his Arms the dying Emperour, and received his laſt Breath; nor the chief Prelate of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Dominions, and who was heard with Admiration in the Councill of <hi>Trent;</hi> And if he proteſted daily, that he would bring Wood to burn his Children, if they were Heretiques: What grace could be expected from him by nocent perſons? There's no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, but that ſeverity hath preſerved that Country from Hereſie, and made impreſſions on the people, whoſe nature is circumſpect, and ſeeks ſafety in all their undertakings.</p>
                  <p>And as to th'Example of the Prince, and that by his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, endeavours have been uſed t'exerciſe the ſame proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in <hi>France.</hi> The ſame ſucceſs hath not been encountred; whether that the Remedy was unſeaſonable, or that our hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:99746:46"/>mour is uncapable to ſubmit to force: It ſeems that the door t'Errour was opened upon that occaſion; Many to whom new things were odious, were loſt by the Curioſity to know what the Doctrine was for which ſo many perſons did run with vehemency, to death, and ſuffered with joy. That vain Image of conſtancy amazed weak ſpirits, and them that knew not, That the Juſtice of the Cauſe, and not the Rigour of Torments made Martyrs, imagined that they could not cheerfully periſh, but for the Cauſe of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Severity then is not good, but for the ſpeculative and fierce humours, as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are, who conſider alwaies the furture and the conſequence of things. To whom gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe appears Cowardize, who neglect them that flatter them, and make themſelves to be feared of them who make diſcovery of fear. It acts alſo powerfully upon the fearfull and Coward people; as they of th'Eaſt, where th'heat of the Air diſſipates that of the Body, and dryes up exceſſively the ſpirits which are th'Inſtruments of Boldneſſe and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage; ſo Monarchies have taken their beginnings in thoſe Countries, the people being eaſily reduced under the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of a ſingle perſon; and <hi>Ottoman</hi> had no labour to make ſlaves of them whom he ſubdued, nor to baniſh liberty from his Dominions, as the greateſt of all Crimes.</p>
                  <p>On the contrary, Gentleneſſe is proper for the governing of the <hi>Germans,</hi> and other people of the North. They are enemies to all force; There's not a Chain which weighs not with them, thoughit be neceſſary and juſt. And th'Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of heat and blood inſpires them with undaunted ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, which makes them reſiſt all ſorts of Domination, if it be not in their hands. Wherefore they would have all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons governed by Common wealths, or at leaſt have no Kings which ſhould not be Elective and ſubordinate to their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. And for that reaſon alſo, 'tis very eaſie to make them revolt againſt the Church, becauſe it was their Mother; and to make them hate the <hi>Pope,</hi> becauſe he was their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour. Inſomuch, that I do not think that the death of ſeven and twenty Lords, whoſe heads were cut off after the battail of <hi>Prague,</hi> and that bloody ſpactacle which they boaſted of to <hi>Germany,</hi> procured ſo much terrour, as it raiſed hatred againſt th'houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Government. And I do not believe that the manner of nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing the War which <hi>Wallaſtein</hi> introduced into that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; The rigour of the Contributions there raiſed; Th'op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the Towns taken, or of them that obeyed; have ſo much aſſuted the Victories of th' <hi>Emperour,</hi> as they have diſpoſed that people to Inſurrections. And if the proſperities
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:99746:46"/>of the <hi>King of Sweden</hi> continue, that they may cauſe a ſtrange revolution, and deſtroy thoſe violent Conqueſts which have neither foot nor root. At the end of th'Account, I do not ſee that th' <hi>Emperour</hi> hath made other Advantage of thoſe great emotions which laſted ſo many years, than in avoiding the Ruine that threatned him; nor that he became the richer for making ſuch an infinite ſort of perſons poor, nor that he did other thing, then impoſe a neceſſity to keep al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies on foot a dreadfull Army to make them affraid, or to ſee his greatneſſe decline, or to give over th'Ambition of rendring himſelfe Maſter of <hi>Germany,</hi> and of reducing the people to a totall deficiency, from whom he could not take any away, the will to rebell. As to the zeal which he hath expreſſed to holy things, and as to th'exerciſe of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion which he re-eſtabliſhed in all places; 'Tis a work whereof th'Apparance is very plauſible and Chriſtian. Yet inſomuch that all-that is but without, and that ſouls give place to Armes, and obey not the truth; 'Tis to be feared that ſuch a Reformation will fall in the change of th' <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours</hi> fortune; and that Hereſie may more dangeouſly overflow than it idd, if it ever recover impunity, and its firſt Licenſe.</p>
                  <p>To further confirm what I have ſaid, I will make uſe of th'evidence of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who confeſs that the <hi>Duke of Alva</hi> was too blame, t'employ gentleneſſe to gain the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gals</hi> who were onely to be overcome; And that is was to make them worſe to flatter them in ſubduing of them. On the contrary, that ſeverity loſt the <hi>Flemmings,</hi> and that the floods of Blood which he there made to run out, the more provoked the rebellion, and gave pretence to diſobedience, to ſhew it ſelf, which had been till then modeſt, &amp; irreſolute. Gentleneſs then in generall, is proper for the Conduct of the <hi>Northern</hi> people, and ſeverity for the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and them of th'Eaſt, for the aforeſaid Reaſons. They that are under a temperate Climate, as the <hi>French,</hi> and whoſe Complexions are tempred by the clemency of th'Heavens, and the ſcitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of Country, have alſo need of a moderate Conduct, and of ſuch a temper of Juſtice as takes impunity from vice, and renders it not alwaies to the Culpable, deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.</p>
                  <p>Upon what hath been ſaid, 'tis eaſie to judge, that it is not alwaies ſafe to act by Imitation; That th'Example of what is practiſed in a Nation, is an ill principle for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of an other Nation; That univerſal propoſalls are dangerous in the publique. And t'eſtabliſh generall Rules to be obſerved of all People, and upon all occaſions, is to fit the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:99746:47"/>Robe of Fables to all the States of the Moon. 'Tis to give the ſame form to two contrary natures; 'Tis to range un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and equall meaſure two different Quantities. And that a Miniſter of State may the better comprehend this truth, which is very Important; Let him know, that except ſome moſt generall propoſitions, which are in the practice of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, as th'ultimate principles of the Metaphyſiques in the Sciences, There' none that is not diſputed and contradicted; which hath not reaſons and examples to favour it, and which are contrary to it, as I have elſewhere ſhewed; and therefore ought either alwaies to be followed, or alwaies to be reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; Let's ſee it by Experience, and diſcourſe in paſſing by of th'uſe of ſeverity and gentleneſs, ſince we are upon that ſubject.</p>
                  <p>they who adviſe that a <hi>Prince</hi> ſhould rather make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be feared, then loved; and that Rigour ſupports a Scepter much better than Eaſineſs of Manners, and Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency; may at once ſay, That though it may be true, that ſoveraigne Authority is equally preſerved betwixt the feare and love of the people; That nevertheleſs the means which gives birth to the firſt of theſe two paſſions, are more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain then thoſe that engender the ſecond: That their ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is more infallible, and that good Deeds act not ſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly upon the ſpirits of men as puniſhments; That 'tis al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies in the power of them who have Forces in their hands, to make themſelves to be feared. But that it is not in the power of them that are good to make themſelves; to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved. That men love, voluntarily and by Election; but fear for the moſt part of neceſſity, and in ſpight of Reaſon, and againſt the reſiſtance of all diſcourſe. That for all times, The Corruption of Mankind hath been ſuch, that it had had more need of Juſtice for to ſubſiſt, then of the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of its Superiours; That, the State of innocency is very rare in the world; but that of Repentance is common, and in continual uſe; &amp; that the Governours have been alwaies more exerciſe to heal Diſeaſes, than to preſerve health, and the good condition of States. That in a word, The Nature of the people, is to fear much, and to love little; but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe that they love not the Reigns under which they live: That they are never content with thei preſent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: That they are ſenſible onely of the memory of things paſt, and hopes of the future; And that ordinarily the dead <hi>Princes</hi> are their delights; And though ſometimes they may have Love for their Maſters, and that their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination therein accompanies their Duty; There's no paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that changeth ſo eaſily in their underſtanding as this;
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:99746:47"/>And whether the Manners of Princes change and degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, or that they are diſguiſed and falſifyed to th'eyes of their ſubjects. There's nothing ſo eaſy as to paſſe them from Love to Diſdaine, and from Diſdaine to Hatred, and to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt. The Life of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, is an illuſtrious example of this Truth; and th' Inconveniences wherein he fell af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had attained the Crowne, make it appeare what foundation is to be laid upon the will of the people, and upon th' inclinations of that beaſt which ſtirrs, and his thr<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>On th' other ſide, it may be ſaid, that no Emperour is fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, nor power better eſtabliſhed, than that which is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon Love; And 'tis certain, that things are conſerved by the ſame cauſes, and with the ſame meanes which give them birth; there's alſo no doubt but that the ſoveraigne Authrority is the firmer, when it is ſupported by the good will of the people, from whence it took its Originall; In the ſecond place, no violent thing is durable, its proper force conſumes it, or ſome other that reſiſts it, and which is greater: And 'tis true, that every ſort of Chaine, ſave that of Love weighes upon the ſpirit of man, and that every ſort of yoak, if it be not voluntary, opreſſeth it; To conclude, to raigne only by ſeverity, is to renounce the peace of the ſpirit; 'tis to charge upon himſelfe the paſſion given to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; 'tis t' expoſe himſelfe to an eternall neceſſity of diſtruſting all perſons, and to make them Enemies whom he would not ſuffer to love him, for fear of not being ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently feared; 'Tis to fall into the the ſame miſchiefs which traverſe jealous husbands, and in over-ſtraining his ſubjects to be faithful, to give them a will to rebell, and to quit their obedience, which would not be truſted to their vertue and to their inclination.</p>
                  <p>To the firſt, Anſwer may be given, that ſeverity alone conſerves very ill the power of a soveraigne; and that t'em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy violence againſt th'evills of a State, 'tis to uſe nothing but paſſion and fire againſt all the Maladies of the body, and every ſort of Ulcers. That if great perſons ſometimes have affected an auſtere and hard humour, and ſeem thereby to maintain themſelves in Authority; That effect neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe proceeds from another cauſe: And, inſomuch that that terrible conduct hath not been alone, and was found in the Company of many great vertues that have tempered it, It hath not done th'evill it was accuſſtomed to do. This was obſerved in the life of <hi>Torquabes,</hi> of Mariuſt of <hi>Sylla,</hi> of
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:99746:48"/>
                     <hi>Corbulon,</hi> and of many others of the Ancients: And of the Moderne, in the Life of the duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> of the Marqueſs of the Holy Croſſe, who left ſuch cruell Markes of his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours to the <hi>Terceres,</hi> of the County of <hi>Fuentes</hi> and <hi>Wail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine</hi> of this time who was ſo abſolute in th'Armies, he commanded, that the name of the Emperour was but th' Image of the Soveraigne power, He exerciſed; If theſe great perſons, I ſay, had known onely how to comand the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up of Gallowſes, and to ſend men to death, they had not been followed by their Souldiers, in the occaſions of glory; and they had been unknown to us, but a ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of Misfortune, whereinto ſeverity doth precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate.</p>
                  <p>It may be alſo aſwered to the ſecond, that Indulgency is a Means, as little ſafe as facile, to give power to raigne, or to compell obedience; that if the firſt men of the paſt and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne ages, ſeem to have neglected ſevere wayes, and th' Examples of Rigour, the better to ſubſiſt in the ſpirits of their ſubjects, or of their ſouldiers, 'Tis that in effect, they had extraordinary Qualities, and I know not what of admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in their perſons, which appeared in their face and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and inſpited reſpect with love into the ſouls of them who came neer them; ſuch were <hi>Alexander, Scipio, Caeſar, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manicus;</hi> ſuch, <hi>Gaſton</hi> of <hi>Foix, Don John</hi> of <hi>Auſtria, Ferrant Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalve,</hi> and the two laſt Dukes of <hi>Gaiſe,</hi> whoſe ſingle preſence-bewitched the world, forced the wills of men in ſpight of Reaſon, and conſtrained their Enemies to change their paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or to ſuſpend it at the ſight of them.</p>
                  <p>From this diſcourſe I draw two Inſtructions, which may be applyed to th' other matters of Policy. The firſt is, That for th' uſe of gentleneſs and ſeverity, and generall Rule cannot be Reſolution muſt be taken upon th'Occaſion; Conſultation had with the nature of Affairs; with the condition of the times; with the Quality of the perſons; and leve the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of th' event to fortune, and t' other cauſes which are without us. The ſecond, That although the difference brought of th'inclinations of divers people, requires or the moſt part a very different application of the Means, which are to be uſed for governing of them; ſo 'tis that as in the <hi>Oeconomy</hi> of th' humane body, and diſpenſation of th' hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours which compoſe it, there's of courſe one that predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates, and which ſerves for a law to Phyſick, and for a that 'tis neceſſary ſometimes to keep under that comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Humour, and that predominant Quality, To raiſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:99746:48"/>alter their order, and change the courſe of certaine Occurences, and according to the nature of the diſeaſes which happen or threaten. 'Tis the very ſame with th' Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of the People and Complexions of States. There's a certaine Conduct which is as naturall to them; but, it ought not to be inviolable. A Miniſter of State ought not to be a ſlave. He may quit it, provided that he doth not abandon it, and may reſume it; and a Miniſter of State is ſometimes conſtrained to go out of th' high way, t'avoide an ill paſſage or an Ambuſh. There are people who are to be retained with Rigour, and whoſe obedience is not aſcertained, but under a ſevere Empire. But that ought not to be eternall; 'Tis good ſometimes to gaine them and not alwayes to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due them; To bend them, and not alwayes to break them; and occaſions doe happen wherein 'tis of neceſſity to flatter them, and to ſtroake them for feare of affrighting them; leſt they take the Bridle in their teeth, and Carry him away, that ought to Lead them.</p>

                  <p>A Miniſter of State ought not onely to conforme his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct to th' Inclination of the people which he governes, or with whom he treats; But he ought alſo to adjuſte it to their power and to their weaknes; He ought t' Imitate that wiſe Phyſician; who conſiders as much the ſtrength of the ſick perſon, as the virtue of the Remedy; and ſeeks the proportion of that which actes, with that which ſuffers. There are States, whoſe Greatneſs is in themſelves: which ſubſiſt upon their owne weight: which can paſſe-by all others: which have very little to feare from without, and can hardly fall but bu their owne weightineſs, nor periſh but by the Corruption within, and by the vices of the noble parts. Such was th' Ancient Republique of <hi>Rome,</hi> after that ſo many Nations had ſubmitted unto it, and that there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained nothing in the world wherewith to fill up th' Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of one of its Citizens, nor ſufficient to make him Great enough without the Ruine of his Country.

In ſhort, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire with Induſtry what of force is wanting in them, either for reſiſtance or enterprize. There are Princes who ſubſiſt onely by the Conveniences of their Country, and by the benignity of its ſcituation: Two great powers betwixt which, It is ſhut up, and to whom It ſerves for <hi>Barriere,</hi> are in perpetuall jealouſie, that th' one or th' other will make its Accommodation of it, &amp; there's nothing that they would not do to hinder them from the change of Maſter, and from ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to a Domination by them ſuſpected; This paſſion of State hath been th' originall of great wars, which have been ſeene in <hi>Piedmont</hi> ſince hundred yeares, and of ſo much <hi>Spaniſh</hi> and <hi>French</hi> blood as hath been ſhed in that Province. There are others, who have quit themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a voluntary dependency upon a greater power, or by reaſon of ſome good turne received, or to be delivered of the Expence from diſturbance and from feare, which the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of a greater brings, when he is no friend, which is ſeldome but to their Advantage, ſo, he is in ſome ſort the Maſter of the petty States, which he protects; without <hi>Citadelle</hi> and Garriſon he Commands them; and he receives when he hath need, conſiderable ſupplyes of Money and Men.</p>
                  <p>There are others who are under a forced Dependancy, and are become Captives without thinking of it, who have given the matter of their Chaine; and furniſhed the Stuffe, whereof the yoak was made that oppreſſeth them: Covetouſneſs hath precipitated the <hi>Genoueſes</hi> into this unhappineſs; That villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous paſſion hath forged their ſervitude: The Money which they have put into the hands of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> hath betrayed them, and by an Inverted order, the Creditors put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Mercy of their Debtors: They cannot now unſay it; they have given them pawns and cannot recover them, and which they will not ſuffer them to looſe; A ſingle free thought cannot enter their ſpirits; They dare not accept th'aid of them who would redeem them for their Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity; and being ſlaves to their Money, they muſt or neceſſity be to the Men who keep it for them. On the other ſide, 'tis a pleaſant way of gaining a State that which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have practiſed towards the <hi>Genoueſes;</hi> It was never doned ſo good cheape, in other places; All others have coſt them ſomething; if the Great Duke be obliged to the defence of the State of <hi>Milan,</hi> they have rendered unto him the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes of the <hi>Toſcane,</hi> and given him <hi>Sienna.</hi> If the Prince o

Let this be ſaid in paſſage.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, There are States which are not conſerved but by reaſon of their weakneſs, and in regard they are ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable, that they deſerve not the violation of Juſtice in a Conquerour, nor that his Ambition be rendred odious for the deſire of them: ſuch is the Common-wealth of <hi>Ragouſe,</hi> which is ſo little, that to this day it hath not provoaked th' Appetite of the <hi>Turk;</hi> &amp; ſo poor, that almoſt all its Revenues is laid out, to feed the great Perſons of the family of <hi>Porte,</hi> and to ſerve for entertainment to the <hi>Sangiaes,</hi> who are their Neighbours. A Miniſter then of State muſt know, That every ſort of State requires a different Conduct; That th' one ought not to ſerve as Example to th' other for Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and when any buſineſs is to be had with them, that they are to be treated withall according to their Power and Liberty. Whilſt the Common-wealth of <hi>Venice</hi> was in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order with <hi>Paul</hi> the fifth, and that Chriſtendom was divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon that Quarrell, the Common-wealth of <hi>Genes</hi> fell into almoſt the like Inconvenience; This nevertheleſſe did bend under the will of the <hi>Pope,</hi> And having caſt it ſelfe into a ſhamefull ſervitude, was carefull to performe ſuch Actions as might deſerve the Name of a lawfull obedience; and that <hi>Spaine,</hi> whoſe Aide it wanted was but too much car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to diſpoſe it, to raiſe a prejudice againſt <hi>Venice.</hi> On the contrary, <hi>Venice</hi> remained inflexible in its pretenſions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it had power to maintaine them, and purſued the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs to th'End, that the Liberty which it had not received but from God, and wherewith it was borne, might not be weakned. The deſignes then of the <hi>Pope,</hi> which proſpered for <hi>Genes,</hi> were vaine for <hi>Venice;</hi> and th' Inequality of thoſe two ſtates could not admit of the ſame Remedies, though they laboured of the ſame Evill, and of the like Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>

                  <p>And nevertheleſs Prudence requires, that, in the Conduct of ſouls, what is beſt in it ſelf be not ſo much conſidered, as what is moſt conformable to them; That a violent ſubjection be not impoſed upon them, for fear leaſt the yoak being made too heavy, it give a deſire to ſhake it off. Heretofore the Churches Arms were very dreadfull, and the greateſt
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:99746:50"/>Princes tremble at the Noyſe of th' Thunder of <hi>Rome;</hi> The Prudence of Paſtors, who made no unlawfull uſe of their powers, &amp; th' opinion had of their ſanctity; cauſed that they who were threatned, held themſelves at that inſtant cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, and that they had even fear of unjuſt excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations: But as there's nothing ſo good, which man doth not abuſe; nor any thing ſo holy which his Malice or fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gility doth not corrupt; It hath hapned that in theſe lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ages, have been ſeen great alterations of Manners in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, and great abuſes in th' exerciſe of Juſtice: There was no fault of <hi>Boniface</hi> th' eighth, and of <hi>Jules</hi> the ſecond, which did not paſſe the bounds of the Spirit, which confines their power, and inſtead of opening the Kingdome of Heaven whereof Jeſus Chriſt had left them the keys, endevoured to take away th' Intereſt of Lands from their true Maſters, and lawfull poſſeſſors; Beſides that, the too frequent uſe of Excommunications, and th' application thereof to matters of nothing; The Sciſmes of the <hi>Popes,</hi> which have vexed the Church, and cauſed many perſons to take up Arms, who ought to have been governed by a ſingle perſon. All this is the cauſe, that they are now leſſe reſpected then they ought to be, and make not ſufficient impreſſions of terrour upon Chriſtian Souls. In effect, There's nothing that ſo much conſerves the reverence due to Holy things, as the Rarity, nor that vilifies them more then to render them po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular; Thoſe things principally which are of an Order ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour to the body, and whoſe effects are not ſenſible, and reſpect another Life then this; have need of theſe precauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that they may be wholſome, Inſomuch that 'tis to miſunderſtand it, to draw a conſequence from the time paſt, when Eccleſiaſtique Diſcipline was in vigour &amp; the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of Chriſtians docile, when there was nothing but heate and flame among the faithfull; when obedience was generall, and that ſuperiours had not ſo much uſe of a Spurre to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke the love of virtue, and to the purſuit of good; as of a Bridle to retaine, and to hinder th' exceſs by th' impetuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Zeal. 'Tis ill done, I ſay, to draw conſequences from that time to this preſent time, when not only Heretiques change the Truths received, but Atheiſts aſſault the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Faith and the Foundations of Religion: In the diſpenſation of Eccleſiaſtical puniſhments, The Prelates and the Soveraigne chief of the Church, ought not to decline th' end, for which God left then the power t'impoſe them: Inſtead of building they ought not to pul down, nor deſtroy a whole body in cutting of a periſhed member and ſick part; To conclude, There's nothing that Superiours, ſpirituall or

Truly, ſince, <hi>Sr.</hi> the <hi>Cardinall</hi> hath had the power of Adminiſtration, it cannot be ſaid, That th' Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of ſtrangers hath put us out of our way, nor that we have loſt our ſelves in following our predeceſſors, and for nor daring to be bolder, &amp; wiſer than they. This great Miniſter of State hath ſo well known the Nature of th' Ill we labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of, and our Boare; and the Remedies have been diſpenſed with ſuch due proportion, and equality, that the defect hindered not the operations, nor th' exceſs ſharpned the diſeaſe; The ſweetneſs which the King uſed towards the <hi>Rochellers</hi> when they were not in condition any longer to reſiſt his forces; The grace which was afforded to Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalls, when they were in his power; and the Clemency he exerciſed when the might have uſed Severity, without blame; and have made examples of Juſtice which could not have had any ill conſequence, nor dangerous revenge; On th' o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide the Comportment at <hi>Privas,</hi> and that ſad ſpectacle which ſeemed to have been procured by ſome ſuperiour providence, To ſupply, it may be, the too great humanity of the King, and that of his Miniſters of State; The Manner of hearkning to the propoſitions of accommodations not to make the culpable deſperate, and to preſs the War, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten victory; To take from them the means of expecting any thing from time, which is th' hope of unfortunate perſons; Th' induſtry which <hi>Sr.</hi> the <hi>Cardinall</hi> hath added to force; Th' Art he hath uſed to ſow diviſion, and to convey diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt amongſt the Rebels: He divided their Intereſts, and hath made them weak for want of Union; The aſſaults of his Eloquence, and of that divine faculty, which hath ſo charmed the Hearers, that all the paſſions that nouriſhed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion were quieted; Th' hotteſt Motions of deſyance they had for us, were ſtayed; The moſt opinionated could not but conſent to what we would have; and the moſt valiant durſt not ſeek their ſafety in Arms but in Obedience, and ſubjection. Moreover the moſt ſcrupulous obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of promiſed things, and that Legall, and new proceeding wherewith fears were not allayed, but their hopes were ſurmounted: That I ſay, hath reconciled all their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; hath rendred the victory perfect and firme in gaining
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:99746:51"/>the wills of the Conquer'd; hath cut off the laſt Roots of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, and finiſhed the work which had been ſo often be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, and as often deſtroyed by ill Fortune or by ill Conduct.</p>
                  <p>If the King would have believed th' old Miniſters of State, and the wiſe perſons that had Governed in other Raignes; He had never aſſaulted the <hi>Hugenots:</hi> He had not offended a party his Father feared, nor touched that Frame which ſtirred not but by ſhakeing the Pillars of the State, and the foundations of <hi>Monarchy;</hi> Inſolency, ſaid they, muſt be ſuffer'd t'avoid Felony; and Lenitives applyed when ſharp Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies were mortall.</p>
                  <p>They nerve Concluded for warre but when it was made to them. Th' End of our Armes was not for Victory but Peaces. They did not embarque to ſayl, but to return to th' Haven from whence we were put out; They could not endure toſſing at Sea; and were they in a ſmall Boat or in a ſhip of Burden they would make for the Land; In the mean time the fire of the Revolt was not put out; The ſprings of diſobedience remained full, and if they were ſtopped for a time from Running, they ſwelled and became great t'over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow the ſtronger, into another Channell. In a word, the King had alwayes Companions in his kingdome; and at moſt the Subjection of Halfe the <hi>French,</hi> conſiſted in ſharing his powers with Him, to leave him the name onely of a Sover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aigne.</p>
                  <p>If the Maxims obſerved during his Minority in Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his Allies, had not been changed nor; more Courage expreſt than when the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſtript the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Savoy;</hi> If our Reliefs had been as faint, and fearfull, as they in that time; and it we had as much feared three Powers as they did one; What had become of <hi>Monſiur Mantove</hi> and of our Reputation? The Liberty of th' Holy Chair had been weakned, and <hi>Italy</hi> in a Chain. They had ſuddenly been over the ditch of <hi>France,</hi> having there nothing abroad more to take; No perſon would have more truſted us; And at this day, we ſhould not have been the Protectors of the weake: we ſhould be the forſakers of th' afflicted. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, if <hi>Sr. the Cardinall</hi> ſhould have had onely in ſight, the Example of our <hi>Fathers,</hi> and their wiſdome; The deſigne of Navigation ſhould have been onely in <hi>Idea,</hi> and we had not ſeene the Progreſſe of a thing whoſe Beginnings aided ſo much for the taking of <hi>Rochell;</hi> and without it, the greateſt States were never but halfe Powerfull, nor but halfe Rich.</p>

                  <head type="sub">That the Counſells of Strangers ought to be ſuſpected by a Miniſter of State.</head>
                  <p>A Miniſter of State ought to ſuſpect the Counſells that come from abroad, what ſhew ſoever they make of good, and what pretence ſoever of God-will they Cloath themſelves withall. Let them take it for certaine, That the greateſt part of <hi>Princes</hi> have neither hate nor friendſhip but for Conveniency, and have no paſſion but what their Intereſt gives them; And therefore no Friendſhip is ſo dear to them as the leaſt of their Affaires; That there's not a Parent whom they will not turne out of a great Good, if he be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo little Dammageable to them; whom they will not ſacrifice, if it turne to their profit; and expoſe them to th' uttermoſt Miſchiefe, if it be for their Accommodation. The faire paſſions of Reſentment for good turnes, and of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment, are th' expreſſions onely of Particular and of Vulgar perſons; They are ſeldome born amongſt Princes. 'Tis a Traffique, and not a Commerce of friendſhip, which is practiſed amongſt them; The lawes of Merchandize enter much eaſier into their Treaties, than the lawes of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, Intereſt is the ſole bond that ties them. And inſomuch that reaſon of State learnes not to do well Generouſly, 'tis no wonder if they know not ordinarily either to owe hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomly, or handſomely to acknowledge. In a word, there's but little Counſell given by Strangers, whoſe ſpring is not tainted, and which is not corrupted either by th' Ambition of them moſt powerfull, or by the jealouſie of Equalls, or by the fear of Inferiours. Great perſons endeavour to catch Inferiours in their Nets, or to do their buſineſs at their Charges; They engage them in their Quarrells, and forget them in their Accommodations, or intereſſe them in others Men's, to keep them under in ayding of them, and retaine the ſecurities they had ſeiſed under Colour of defending them; Equalls would be very glad to withdraw themſelves from Concurrence; To gaine th' upper hand, and not to ſerve for Counterpoiſe in the forces of the others, nor obſtacle to the Greatneſs whereunto they aſpire; Inferiours are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in fear of great Perſons when they are ambitious and look upon them as Monſters, from whom they expect to be devoured. They cannot have good will for them, whom they diſtruſt; and they raiſe no Altars nor offer ſacrifices for them, but as th' <hi>Auncients</hi> did to the Plague and to a
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:99746:52"/>Feavour to be preſerved from an Evill which they feared.</p>
                  <p>In the begining of the Civil diſcords for the Matter of Religion, and when the new Sect ſevered them from th' obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience due to the <hi>King</hi> whom it had withdrawn from th' obedience due to the Church, <hi>Philip</hi> the ſecond cauſed <hi>Katherine</hi> of <hi>Medicis</hi> to be advertized by <hi>Manique</hi> his ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, that <hi>It concerned her much to take great care not to flatter th' Evill, or to come to any Compoſition with it;</hi> That lenitive Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies were Mortall; and that Rebellion and Hereſie were to be purſued by the ſword and fire. I doubt not but the <hi>Councill</hi> of <hi>Philip</hi> had th' honour of God for their End, which was offended by that new Doctrine, and th' intereſt which was Common to him with all th' other Princes, Not to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit diſobedience in the States of other Princes. But in the choice of the Meanes he propoſed t' oppoſe that Evill and to fight it; 'Tis certaine that He conſidered not ſo much the Effect it would produce, in <hi>France,</hi> as the Good the low <hi>Countryes</hi> would receive by it, where the Contagion was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready entred; He would make us ſwallow the Medicine for the purging of his ſubjects. He thought t' aſtoniſh the culpable of his Countrey, by example of the Juſtice, which ſhould be acted in ours; and take away the heart of Hereſie, when it ſhould ſee it ſelfe ſo ill handled in other places, and be taken every where for th' hatred of <hi>Princes,</hi> and horrour of the people. Lets obſerve here, upon occaſion, That the Prince whom they called the <hi>Solomon</hi> of his Age hindered to his power the <hi>Flemings</hi> from taking Religion for the pretext of th'Inſurrection they ſtudied, and th'Impatience they had to riſe; He ſaw cleerly that they who had ſo often quarrelled their Princes being preſent, and could never Love but the race of them; would hardly containe themſelves in their Abſence, and permit the Domination of ſtranger Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors. But he judged alſo that it was eaſie t'order the people that Mutined when the' engaged not God in their Revolt, and oppoſed not the Command of providing for their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, to that of obedience to their ſuperiours. T' avoid that, he accords them all their demands, though they were unjuſt: He takes away the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Garriſon wherewith they ſaid they were oppreſſed; He conſents that the Governours of ſtrange places ſhould be Natives of the Country, and named by the States. He remits the <hi>Cardinal Grantuelle</hi> to the <hi>Franche</hi> County whoſe perſon was odious unto them, and Conduct inſupportable. In brief, for the love of them, He overthrows the functions of Soveraignty and choſe rather to receive the Law from his <hi>Catholique</hi> ſubjects, than to be conſtrained to give it to the <hi>Heretique</hi> Rebells. But he knew
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:99746:53"/>too late Nature of the people and their diſeaſes; And as 'tis ſometimes good, when th' Appetite of Novelty is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed, which vexed it, and tired with its owne diſorders, To bring it back with ſweetneſs; To give it liberty to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire from Evill with ſome ſhew of Reputation, and to ſeem leſſe Culpable then It was; That nothing but force can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it, when it begins to ſhake and is full of fancies of the future and of hopes of Change: That to flatter them is to loſe them, when they are in that Humour; and 'tis then that they make themſelves to be feared, when the leaſt Evidence of feare is diſcovered unto them: Th' eaſineſs of granting the firſt demands doth furniſh them with boldneſs to make new ones; The deſire of evill is increaſed in giving them powers t' execute it; and at laſt, 'Tis found, that inſtead of a weak and irreſolute Mutiny as it was, A powerful enemy is made, and an Irreconcilable perſecutor. I handle this Matter very particularly in the ſecond part of this work; So 'tis that <hi>Philip</hi> fell into th' Inconveniency, which he had a deſigne t'avoyd, and he ſaw Religion periſh, and his Subjects of the <hi>Low Countries</hi> to rebell, for not uſing ſeaſonable Remedies, which might have wrought, if they had been applied in ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; in employing Severity and Gentleneſs in counter time, and in making too much or too little uſe of th' one or th' other; It may be alſo that there was of Fate in th' Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident of that new Power, and that God ſuffered it to riſe in oppoſition to the <hi>Spaniſh Ambition;</hi> and to ſtop, with ſo ſmall a thing that Torrent which threatned th' overflow of all his Neighbour-Countryes.</p>
                  <p>Our Kings alſo, under whom Hereſie hath riſen, have ſpoiled all in following violent Counſells; They have all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes either ſtrained too much or ſlacked too much: And, as if they had been carried with Contrary windes, They never knew, how to take the Medium, nor find the temper betwixt and Exceſſive Rigour, and a too Looſe Indulgency. The ſhamefull Peaces, accorded in divers times tho th' <hi>Hugu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots,</hi> ſad <hi>Edicts</hi> made in their favour, declare cleerly what ſpirit acted in <hi>France;</hi> and that there was no need of fighting Battails, nor of the burning of Townes, for to put things in the State they were before the warr. On th' other ſide, the violent deſignes, and bloody Reſolutions which were taken t'ill purpoſe, have been the fruits of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Counſells, and of <hi>I alian</hi> ſuggeſtions; Th' impatience which ſome had to ſee our Miſeries finiſhed, have retarded the Cure in making too great haſte; And th' hopes which others had to make profits of them, hath been the Cauſe that they enflamed more, and prepared a long and new Matter for our Diſcords, which were of Advantage to them.</p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:99746:53"/>
                  <p> Th' Execution of <hi>St. Bartholomew</hi> is a work of their ſpirit, &amp; they glory that their King had a particular hand in it, and that the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> did adviſe it in his journey to <hi>Bayone.</hi> I will not diſcourſe of the nature of the Action, which found even Catholique ſpirits divided, and their opinions diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to approve or condemn it; Th' Incertitude wherein they alwaies were, in what manner King <hi>Charles</hi> concurred; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by pretenſion, or by a pure deſigne, and the particular reſentment of a <hi>Prince,</hi> which ingaged with the Zeal of publique good; are the cauſe that no judgement can be made thereof, but what may be dangerous or raſh. I ſuſpend mine alſo, to reſt me upon the ſucceſs which was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme to th' Hopes were had of it; And were it that we knew not how to make uſe of our advantage; or that th' Election of the Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> for King of <hi>Polonia,</hi> loſt the fruits of the victory that was at hand; or that God would not bleſſe an Action wherein it was preſumed, that the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Faith, whereof he was alwaies Protector, was viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; We have ſeen the Fire the more kindled, which they thought had been put out by that bloud-letting; and pretence given to cruelty, to be animated againſt the Catholique bloud.</p>
                  <p>The Cardinall of <hi>Lorrain</hi> alſo, made a great wound in the State and Church, in being promoter of the diſcourſe of <hi>Poiſſy.</hi> After he had been ſo contrary to the Proteſtant Miniſters. The perſons being of obſcure birth, and their Lives charged with faults; who had been ſhaken by many Declarations and Edicts; who had ſo often ſhun'd the Light for to ſave themſelves in dark places and in Woods; who had deliberated upon the Doctrine they publiſhed: To bring forth I ſay this people to a day ſo glorious as the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall had made it, to draw them to ſo famous a Combate, and to give them the meeting in the Field, where they had him for Adverſary, and the King and the Princes for Spec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators; It muſt be confeſſed that he was much too blame, and that it was to paſs too dangerouſly from one extream to another. He ought to have believed, that it was a means to cheriſh them in Errour that were ſhaking, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme them that were irreſolute: That that Honour would exceſſively ſwell their heart: That it would give them a greater Opinion of their perſons and doctrines, than they had before and would put thoſe proud ſpirits into a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion never to Renounce the propoſitions ſo ſolemnly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated. He might have believed, that no jealouſie is ſo vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent as that which we take, in favour of our Opinions: And for the matter of Sect, that come into the World; Th'
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:99746:54"/>Authors ought to be gained before they are publiquely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared; or elſe they muſt be deſtroyed.</p>
                  <p>But when they had overcome the firſt encounterd reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and that apprehenſion which the greatneſſe of their Enterprize gave them; and that the uncertainty of the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs was ceaſed; The diſeaſe muſt take its Courſe of Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity; Hope and fear are weak Remedies againſt it, and Man labours in vain, If God doth not ſhew himſelfe with a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull Arme to defend his own cauſe. The example of <hi>Luther</hi> was freſh in memory, and the cauſes of the miſerable Schiſm in <hi>Germany</hi> known to all the World. So long as <hi>Luther</hi> did only Hazzard his Doctrine, and had no other deſigne but to caſt out his ſpight, and revenge the wrong he believed was done to them of his Order [for not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting them to preach, as they were accuſtomed, th' Indulgencies, in the <hi>Duchy</hi> of <hi>Suxe</hi>]; It had been ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to have reduced him: But after he had conferred with Cardinall <hi>Caietan;</hi> That he had been heard of <hi>Charles</hi> th' Emperour, and that <hi>Leon</hi> the tenth had fulminated againſt him; He changed the paſſion; Vanity ſucceeded cheller, and th' honour to have to do with ſo great perſons, renders him irreconſilable. In vaine after, the Meſſengers of <hi>Paul</hi> the third indeavoured to ſweeten that ſharp ſpirit: In vain, did he repreſent unto him th' evill would happen, in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrowing the peace of the World for a doubtfull beliefe; And in vain did he offer him <hi>Red Hatts,</hi> and the firſt digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Church for the price of his converſion; All that, moved him not; That ambitious man could no longer ſubmit after he had conteſted with <hi>Cardinals, Emperours, Popes.</hi> And after he had been made equall to them; He could not believe himſelfe great enough, if any perſon were above him. This digreſſion may ſeem, affected, but it wil be never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs profitable: Lets return to our ſubject. 'Tis then true, that 'tis almoſt an inevitable neceſſity to receive or demand, Counſell; But 'tis an extream diſgrace not to be able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve of ones ſelfe, and to diſtinguiſh betwixt anothers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and the good of our affairs. Behold other Examples: <hi>Peter of Medicis</hi> whoſe imprudence and misfortune made him famous in Story; tooke Refuge at <hi>Venice,</hi> after he was driven from <hi>Florence. Charles</hi> th' Eighth, who was the ſubject of his diſgrace, offered alſo to be the cauſe of his Reſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and in reſtoring him to his firſt powers, to aſſure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe of the <hi>Florentines,</hi> who were ſo neceſſary for his Italian deſignes; He adviſed him then of his Intentions, and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him his Aid for that purpoſe. <hi>Peter</hi> conſults the Republique, and demands what he ought to do. The <hi>Senate</hi> who had jealouſie of <hi>Charles</hi>'s ſtay in <hi>Italy;</hi> who would not
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:99746:54"/>have him take Root there; who had it then in conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, how to ſend him beyond the Mountaines, and to releaſe by Conſequence <hi>Florence,</hi> which was the breaſt of his Army, and of his Intereſts; diſſwade <hi>Peter</hi> from caſting himſelfe into th' Armes of the <hi>King</hi> to gaine his Returne. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent to him the danger of imploying ſo great a Mediator; That it would more inflame the hatred of his Country-men againſt him, and that they conceive the <hi>King</hi> would ſell the grace he ſhould procure him, and oblige him at the Charges of the Common Liberty; So with theſe Reaſons, whoſe apparance was ſpecious, and with the promiſes they made him to labour his returne, The deſignes of <hi>Charles,</hi> and th' hopes of <hi>Peter</hi> were fruſtrated.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Venetians</hi> who are ſo induſtrious to counſell others, and who for th' opinion of wiſdome they have gained in the world, are ſometimes Conſulted with, even from th' utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Confines of <hi>Aſia;</hi> Take no Counſell from others but for Conveniency; nor otherwiſe, than, as an Evidence of th' affection of them that give it; All the <hi>Powers</hi> of <hi>Europe</hi> were intereſſed in the diſturbance of th' Interdict; The <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and the <hi>Turkes,</hi> the <hi>Catholiques</hi> and the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> did engage, and there was not a Prince which made not offers, or gave advice to the <hi>Republique;</hi> Nothing of that nevertheleſſe could ſhake it. She ſtood immoveable in its proper Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and never wandred from her End, whatſoever was propoſed to the Contrary. I do not think it can be ſaid, that Counſells from abroad have acted amongſt us ſince <hi>Sr. the Cardinall</hi> hath been in the government, nor that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Infuſions have ſeduced us, ſince He governed. I do not think that it can be reproached to this Great Miniſter of State, That the Gold of our Neighbours; hath put out his eyes, t'open his heart to their ſuggeſtions; nor that their ſubtlity hath Cauſed them to unty the Tongue to diſcover the Kings deſignes, and the ſecrets of the State; Heretofore they governed in our Counſells, though in the poſture of third perſons. They have there propoſed their opinions by <hi>French</hi>-Interpreters; ſome of our Miniſters of State were but bodies aſſumed, to which their ſpirits gave Motion and language; And in regard they were venall perſons; no man need wonder, If they were for them that would give moſt, and by Conſequence their's; ſince they never found too high a price for the Purchaſe of the fidelity of the ſubjects of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Princes.</p>
                  <p>But t' aſſault with theſe baſe temptations a Perſon who would not make uſe of all the Juſt wayes of getting wealth; who had ſo often refuſed to ſearch into the Coffers, which his Maſter opened unto him; who made ſcruple of receiving
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:99746:55"/>Benefits from a <hi>Prince,</hi> which were offered him. T'avoid the gathering of the ſpoiles of an unhappy perſon, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes Hazarded all his Meanes t'aſſure ours. There's no reaſon for it.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, that Intereſt which hath been ever powerfull in <hi>France;</hi> The feare that hath been long entertained of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voaking Neighbour forces, hath often ſpoiled our Affairs or weakned our Reputation. For feare of diſpleaſing them, a pernicious Compleaſancy was exerciſed in favour of them; their propoſalls were harkned unto with too much reſpect; They durſt not break their Deſignes with force; they were diverted by Treaties, and interventions. And inſomuch that we had not Courage, to act with them as Equalls; They took the boldneſs to treate with us as our ſuperiours and Maſters. A ſtrange Maxim that poſſeſſed ſome ſpirits, to permit in private all the tricks of a Mutinous faction, under pretence that we wanted power to repreſſe it, and to ſuffer the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to do a part of what they would do abroad, t'avoyd diſorder with them; and leaſt th' hatred of that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable Nation ſhould be added to the ſpight of diſconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted perſons, and to the diſturbance of Rebells. It was upon this Principle that they ſuffered the <hi>Duke of Savoy</hi> to periſh, and that the frontiers of the State of <hi>Milan</hi> were enlarged to the foot of the Mountaines; It was upon the ſame prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, that Affronts were permitted to be done to the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians;</hi> That they have ſuffered a perſon to triumph with their veſſells, as a Conquerour, who had taken them, onely as a Pirate, and whom they forced t'eſcape into <hi>Gradiſque,</hi> and conſerved that place to th'houſe of <hi>Auſtria:</hi> In ſearch whereof, they have formerly conſumed a part of their treaſure, and thirty thouſand Men without taking of it. 'Tis by reaſon of this principle alſo, that th' <hi>Hugonots</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playned (whether of right or wrong is not for me to judge) of the Breach of the peace of <hi>Montpellier</hi> to the prejudice of the <hi>King's</hi> Intentions. And that they who made it to ſuppreſs another <hi>Caballe</hi> which could not ſubſiſt but by the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation of the warr; had alſo broken it t'accommodate th' humour of <hi>Italie</hi> and of <hi>Spaine,</hi> where ſome murmured, that a party was ſuffered to Live, which, as was Imagined, might have been ſtiffled. And others were angry for the remiſſion of our Evils, and for the Interruptions of our diſcords, which they would make perpetuall. How ever, It was, that breach, whether true or pretended hath been the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the moſt dangerous warre, which as yet we have had in the State; and the Miniſters of State, which ſucceeded had received (according to the Cuſtome) the ſhame of the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:99746:55"/>faults of their Predeceſſors, if they had not the Virtue to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire them.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Sr.</hi> the <hi>Cardinall</hi> entred with Counſells as bold as diſintereſſed; He knew the power of our Neighbours, and the forces of his Maſter; He conceived that all his Maſter's forces were not to be imployed againſt them, ſo long as they held theirs divided in divers places; which without queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they will alwaies do, till they ceaſe to be Ambitious, or become Weake.</p>
                  <p>And therefore upon this Infallible Principle, the King hath beaten down all that did ariſe in his Kingdome againſt his Authority, and hindred the great perſons abroad to grow great at the Charges of the leſſer; and of th' Allies of <hi>France.</hi>

                  <head type="sub">How Adviſes from <hi>Rome,</hi> and from the Mediation of the Pope, are to be entertained.</head>
                  <p>WHat I have ſaid in the Precedent Diſcourſe reſpects only the <hi>Princes</hi> manifeſtly intereſſed, and whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions are ſuſpected to their Neighbours, by reaſon of ſome irregular paſſion they labour under. A conſideration apart muſt be made of the Adviſes that come from <hi>Rome,</hi> and Interventions of <hi>Popes</hi> in th' affairs of other Princes; But inſomuch as that dignity which regards onely the ſpirit, and th'hopes of th'other Life is joyned in time to a temporall power, wherewith it is not incompatible; It hath alſo hapned, that they who have beene provided of both, have caſt themſelves on other Intereſt then thoſe of God, and mingled the Zeale of the ſalvation of Souls with the paſſions of th' Earth. And as 'tis ſeen that Man ſuffers himſelf to be raviſht with th' Objects of the ſenſes, and acts not but according to th'animal faculties, though he have ſpiritual and divine faculties. In like manner ſome <hi>Popes</hi> have been ſeen to forget the functions of the Chiefs of the faithfull, in addicting themſelves wholly to the functions of the Princes of the World, and place Ambition and Avarice in the Throne of Holineſſe; Moreover ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons have been found who by intereſſed deſignes or with an indiſcreet heat have endeavoured to over-ſtraine the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:99746:56"/>greatneſſe of <hi>Popes,</hi> and for ſome reaſons of comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, attribute unto them more juriſdiction over <hi>Catholique Princes,</hi> than God hath given them; they have by that means blown up the Courage of ſome of the <hi>Popes;</hi> They have made them t'aſſume unreaſonable pretenſions; They have cauſed that boldneſſe in them, to trample under their feet the Crowns of Soveraigns, and to march upon their Heads, who acknowledge God onely to be above them in temporall, Juriſdictions. From thence are borne the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rells, they have had with divers Princes, and chiefly with th' <hi>Emperours</hi> of the <hi>West;</hi> from thence have been kindled ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Warrs in <hi>Germany,</hi> which have paſſed into <hi>Italy,</hi> and brought deſolation to all <hi>Europe;</hi> From thence, were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med thoſe famous factions of <hi>Guelphs</hi> and <hi>Gibelins,</hi> which have divided the Fathers from their Children, which put Schiſm into Families; which made Citties to be burnt, and Provinces to be plunderd; and held the World in combuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for a Quarrell which was not that of Jeſus Chriſt. The doubtfull pretenſions, or leſſe cleer, which ſome <hi>Popes</hi> would paſſe for indubitable, have occaſioned that they who were intereſſed, have maintained their Rights with the more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, and with leſſe reſpect then they ought; and did caſt themſelves into extreamities in a Cauſe, which moderation might have made lawfull.</p>
                  <p>But moreover, When a <hi>Pope</hi> either by his proper Motion or by the ſuggeſtions of Juglers and Flatterers, wherewith ſometimes they are infeſted, hath aſſumed a Right he had not, though his deſigne hath not proſpered, and that he hath encountred impediments, which have ſtopped his courſe, ſome indiſcreetly zealous Authors have been found, who ſet forth his Action for a Title, t' entitle the ſubſequent <hi>Popes</hi> to that Right, and to re-ingage them in a Quarrell which ſhould be made as ſtrong by their own Authority, as by that, wherewith they ſecure themſelves by reaſon of the preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that it hath the favour of time. From thence it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſeth, that they are very ſenſible of what they conceive to touch them; that there's ſo much ſeverity at <hi>Rome,</hi> for what concerns them; and when that matter enters into th' Affairs which are treated with them, or into the Negotiations which their Agents mannage, that great Circumſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are there to be uſed; Th' Eye muſt be open to all things, and to tread with addreſs and lightneſs upon ſo ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery a Pavement.</p>
                  <p>I will place here a long conſideration, but profitable, and that ſhall enter without Violence upon the ſubject in hand. The wealth which hath been given to the Church for the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:99746:56"/>glory of God, and for th' Ornament of that fair Hierarchy, which compoſeth the Myſticall body of <hi>Jeſus Christ;</hi> hath had in many of their members an Effect contrary to their End. The Soveraigne Shepheards themſelves whoſe Lifes are the Lamps of the Goſpel, that it be not hid under a Buſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell; have ſometimes given ſcandalous examples in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; Their Manners have not ſhined, but to lead into pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipices; They have betrayed the bounties of Honeſt Men, and converted the Monuments of the Piety of the <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines,</hi> of the <hi>Pepins,</hi> and of the <hi>Charlemaignes</hi> into inſtruments of Ambition, or of ſome other paſſion, leſs Honeſt: And as all the motions of the ſoul, when they are irregular, and that imagination in ſtead of diſcourſe doth governe them; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into a wilderneſs, and find no object to confine them, no bridle to check them; So the wealth of the Holy Chair, though it be great, hath been little to ſatisfie immoderate deſires, and the too vaſt deſignes of ſome <hi>Popes,</hi> and to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh th' exceſs of their Expences. That hath obliged ſome of their Agents, who burnt with a contrary paſſion to ſeek out extraordinary Means for Money; and to have recourſe to violence and ſacriledges, being unable by lawfull Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients to ſatisfie the Prodigality of their Maſters, or their perſonall Avarice; They have not only ſet impoſitions, and ſubſidies upon their temporall Subjects as other Princes do; But they have alſo abuſed what was moſt holy in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; They put to ſale the things that were above Price; They have ſold the merits of Jeſus Chriſt; and ſold to children what came from the Indulgency of their Mother. Beſides this, the venality of Offices, which ſome <hi>Popes</hi> have permitted to be introduced into the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that Spring of Rapine, which hath been ſtopped to th' uttermoſt of their power, in all well poliſhed States; The greatneſs of their kindred which ſome have procured with too much heat; The Warrs wherein they did embarke themſelves to ill purpoſe; The ſumptuous buildings and the too proud goods: In brief all that furniture, which was ſeen at <hi>Rome,</hi> of things which were not invented but for vanity or for pleaſure, and whereof the moſt unprofitable were the moſt precious; All this, hath raiſed an ill opinion of the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of th' Order in many who cannot diſtinguish it from the Perſon, nor make a difference of what was of Gods Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from what proceeded from the Corruption of Man. The face then of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> ſo notoriouſly defamed hath cauſed ſome to confound it, with that of the Church, though they are two very different things; That they applyed the ſpots of th'one to th'other that had none at all, and have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:99746:57"/>againſt the <hi>Holy Chair</hi> becauſe they could not ſuffer the vices of the <hi>Pope.</hi> Th'Authors nevertheleſſe of this great Attempt have not ſinned of ignorance, and were not carried thereunto by the zeal of th' honour of God. They knew well, that the Licence of Manners is not incompati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with the purity of opinions; That the Will may follow Evill though the Reaſon doth not approve of it; and that the ſame Authority which forbids us t'imitate the deboſhes of Paſtors, commands us to reſpect their doctrine, and to hold us in the way they teach us, diſtinct from the myre they are fallen into; But they were put on, by other Motives. Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice and Spight animated them againſt the dignity, to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged of the perſons that poſſeſſed it; Inſtead of ſtopping at th' abuſes they exerciſed, they aſſaulted the power which God had given them. Inſtead of pruning the branches, they would cut down the body, and take away their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours Life, to hinder him from Doing ill. And as thoſe Creatures who draw Poyſon from Flowers, and Simples, whereof men make perfumes and Medicines; Inſtead of admiring the care God hath for his Church, in hindring it from ſpoyle in the midſt of corruption, and to ſinke in ſo violent tempeſts; They have ſevered themſelves from her and have indeavoured to cut the bands of the Members and the Head; and t' aboliſh that divine dependancy, which makes a regular body, as Diſſolution makes a Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</p>
                  <p>God alſo hath raiſed many great perſons to fight the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of the Revolted, and to revenge th'injury done him in deſtroying, what was of his Inſtitution, for the vices of Men; and in judging of the virtue of the Sacraments by the goodneſs of the Prieſts; and the force of the work, by the merit of the workman: But as 'tis hard for th' humane ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to obſerve moderation in its deſignes, and that it be not tranſported in the purſuit of good, for which it hath paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. It hath alſo happened, that they who have runne to the Relief of th' <hi>Holy Chair,</hi> have truly proſpered in that defence, and repelled th' impoſture of them that have aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted it; yet all have ſtayed there; ſome have paſſed their bounds, and being preſſed with too much heat, which the love of truth had inſpired into them; have not only ſupported the ſpirituall power of the <hi>Pope,</hi> but have alſo at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed unto him a temporal which was unknown to th' Apoſtles; unheard of, in the Primitive Church; which gives jealouſie t' other Princes; which hath not ot this time edified, which hath deſtroyed much and made Schiſm to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into thoſe States which had been Catholique, the ſpace
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:99746:57"/>of many ages. And inſomuch that they who have been raiſed to this Supream dignity, which ſevers them from the Community of men, are nevertheleſs men, &amp; ſometimes have common inclinations; There's no wonder, if ſome of them are glad to ſee their Authority extended, To ſee themſelves made more powerfull then they thought to be; that the light which doth ſurround them is greater and diſperſeth its Ray, further then they did imagine; and if they are eaſily perſwaded to a thing ſo conformable to their deſires and to the moſt violent appetite of reaſonable Nature which is that of Domination. Inſomuch, that 'tis not only true that the change of Fortune is ordinarily accompanied with the change of Manners, but alſo ſometimes of Opinions; That it diſorders all the powers of the Soul; That it alters the diſpoſition of th'Underſtanding, after it hath changed that of the Will. And ſome <hi>Popes</hi> have judged more favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of the greatneſs of the <hi>Holy Chaire,</hi> when they were in it; they they did before, when they were but ſingle <hi>Cardinals,</hi> or in ſome lower dignity. Wherefore in ſubjects, which look either directly or obliquely upon th' <hi>Holy Chaire,</hi> A Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of State ought to be very circumſpect: He muſt ſlide upon that Pavement, if he muſt paſſe upon it; If he be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to touch upon ſo delicate parts, Let it be done with a ſubtile and light hand, and that he do not pierce too deep, if it be poſſible, into a matter wherein it will be hard not to be offended, if he do not offend. Above all, that he ſtay al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies in the bounds of Reaſon, and in the bounds of Juſtice. That he take nothing away from another, but that he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit not, any thing to be taken away from his Maſter; That his imprudence, or ſoftneſs do not occaſion any prejudice for the future to the State, and that he remember the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding of <hi>Charles the fifth,</hi> when he came into <hi>Italy</hi> to be Crowned <hi>Emperour.</hi> The <hi>Legates</hi> who were ſent to receive him, prayed him that he would ſwear to do no wrong to the Liberties of the <hi>Church,</hi> nor injure the <hi>spouſe of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> He anſwered that he would ſwear neither to alter the rights of the Church, nor the pretenſions of th' <hi>Empire; That had an aspect to the Citties of Pleaſance and of Parma, which the one pretended to be a Fiefe of th' Empire, th' other of the Holy Chaire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Truly, <hi>Sr. the Cardinal</hi> behaved himſelf ſo well in Occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of this nature, that the Rights of the Crown and Dignity of th' <hi>Holy Chaire</hi> have been inviolable, in his hands; That nothing but Juſtice held the Ballance, that he gave to God and <hi>Caeſar</hi> their due; and maintained equally the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of a Miniſter of State, and of a Prince of the Church;
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:99746:58"/>He is not ignorant of the Temper which ought to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt a blind Zeal, and Licenſe ſcarce Catholique; He knowes the way was to be held betwixt theſe two precipices; He knowes how to ſaile without ſtriking upon the Rocks; He cannot wander for want of light; He hath a moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found knowledge of Holy things, and of the things of the world; and the <hi>Sorbone</hi> admired him as their Ornament, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it did reverence him for their benefactor and protector.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore he took care not to ſee with other Mens Eyes, as others have done, or to Move with the paſſion of ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; So no ſoul alſo was ever leſſe prepoſſeſſed then his; or more direct in its apprehenſions; There's no Irregularity in the functions of his powers, and with exception to the Commerce of Faith which is alwayes priviledged, the Will gives not its opinions to th' Underſtanding, but receives its heate, and affections, from his diſcourſe and his Illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Wherefore 'tis eaſie to judge how imprudent the Calumny of them was, who aſſaulted him during the Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation of <hi>Cardinal Barberin,</hi> or a little after. <hi>Rome</hi> did not complaine of Him, and th' <hi>Holy Father</hi> knew well that the neceſſities of State, and th' hidden Cauſes of its <hi>Conduct,</hi> do not ever permit; That to the zeal of honeſt Men, all be given that they would have. None then but ill <hi>Frenchmen</hi> have complained, or ſtrangers that hate us; and to whom Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences are good, when Cauſes are wanting to them; That cry us down who are incenſed againſt us; Thoſe black Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſts alſo, and thoſe violent and ſharp Writings which <hi>France</hi> hath ſeen, have done no hurt to the Reputation of this Great Miniſter of State. They have reſembled thoſe ſtinking Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours which are exhaled from Mooriſh Grounds, which evidence cleerly the Corruption of the place, whence they come, but infect not the Sun againſt which they ariſe. They have given themſelves the Lye, by the things that have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened. The time hath inverted them upon their Authors. They have ſeen that Delinquent of th' <hi>Hugonots</hi> faſtned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>variably to the Ruine of all that was rebellious in that party. They have ſeen <hi>Rochell</hi> fall in part by the cares of that <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall</hi> of <hi>Rochell,</hi> They have ſeen Hereſy humbled by that Great polititian, and reduced under the Common Right and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Obedience, as well of Obedience as of Opinions to his Mode: they have ſeen what he dared in th' Affaires of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur</hi> of <hi>Mantove;</hi> what he undertook t'aſſume the Liberty of th' <hi>Holy Chaire,</hi> and to what he expoſed himſelfe for the Love of that <hi>Rome,</hi> which by imputation was deſpiſed by him; They have ſeen, that neither th' open force of Conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red perſons, ſtrangers; nor the great Reſiſtance of ill diſpoſed
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:99746:58"/>
                     <hi>Frenchmen;</hi> Barrenes nor the Plague; could hinder the <hi>King</hi> from being the Liberator of <hi>Italy,</hi> as He hath been the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorer of <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But how hath the Prudence of that Great Miniſter of State ſhined in the Diſpute of th' Authority of the <hi>Pope,</hi> which had been awakened ſome years ſince amongſt us? How dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous hath he been in the Manadgement of a Matter ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous? How very happy in laying dead that Quarrell which ſhall ever be fatall to <hi>Religion,</hi> and which cannot be deterred but by opening the dore to Schiſme? He alone found th' Expedients to pacifie the <hi>Sorbone,</hi> which was in Tumult on that Subject. To re-joynt the body which was torne in parts; To reduce opinions, too much flattered; To content the <hi>Pope,</hi> and to preſerve our Liberties and the Rights of the Crowne. This action was ſo neceſſary, that without it our Affaires had never taken a Courſe ſo advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous as they did, and ſo difficult, that I dare affirme, It could not have been done but by a principall Miniſter of State, by a Prince of the <hi>Church,</hi> by a great <hi>Theologian,</hi> and excellent <hi>Polititian</hi> altogether.</p>

                  <p>WHat I have ſaid in the Precedent Diſcourſe is not to Condemn the wealth of the <hi>Church,</hi> but to blame them that abuſe it; Nor, to conclude, that ſhe is not ever the ſame though ſhe was born poor, and that ſhe is now rich; That Charity is diminiſhed: That the Manners of the greateſt part of particular perſons is Degenerated; and that their Lifes are contrary to theirs, who were the firſt of the <hi>Faithfull.</hi> 'Tis ever the ſame face, though the good Graces are not the ſame, and the Colour is gone; The figures re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines; The features and proportions leave it not, and 'tis ſtill the ſame Soul which gives it Life; Tis alwayes the ſame River though its water is ſometimes troubled and ſometimes cleere, that it flowes at one time and ebbs at another. The Channell is permanent, The ſpring is fixed, and its Courſe tends alwayes to the Sea which is its firſt Originall. There are in Religion, things, of an eternall Subſtance; and there are, that may ſuffer Change and Alteration. And as the beginnings of Nature are alwayes weak, and perfection comes by degrees into her works; ſo that which iſſues pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from th' hand of God is uſually perfect, and if it ſtay not in that ſtate; Tis the fragility of Man that alters it, and the neceſſity of the Condition that makes the Change.</p>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:99746:59"/>
                  <p> Since God determined that great Deſigne of the purchaſe of men, and that he would be th' End and Meanes of their happineſs; It was Convenient, that the <hi>Church</hi> which he ſhould eſtabliſh, ſhould be born poore. And, that the world might know it to be his work; It was neceſſary that ſhe ſhould be raiſed by Meanes, contrary to th' ordinary; That ſhe ſhould triumph over Riches, in her poverty; over Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in Diſdaine; and over the Wſedome of th' Age, in the Ignorance of humane things: Otherwiſe truly, if it had come in Abundance; If its Entry into the world had been invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roned with Glory; and the doctrine which ſhe brought, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded by the ornaments of <hi>Rhetorique</hi> and ſubtiltyes of <hi>Philoſophy;</hi> It had been under jealouzie with us: No perſon would have been aſtoniſhed at the progreſſe It hath made in ſo Little a time: and that it being come out of a Corner of <hi>Paleſtine;</hi> It had paſſed in an inſtant to th' uttermoſt Bounds of th' Earth, and penetrated even to a world ſeverd from ours; No perſon would have thought it ſtrange, that Covetous Men ſhould run after wealth; That Ambition had followed <hi>Pompe,</hi> and that Eloquence plaid with the Credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of ſimple perſons. That famous Impoſtor, who hath found ſo many followers and whoſe Errors entertaine, as yet to this day, two thirds of our world; had been alone, if he had been poor; and had never deceived the people if he had not ſubdued them. It was the neceſſary, That Religion truly divine, had the markes of the Principle from which She proceeds. That ſhe comes Contrary to the Rules of Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and eſtabliſhes her ſelf by that which ought to deſtroy her. But as ſhe hath the Love of God for her End, and Charity for her Neighbour, and that chiefly it ought to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh the diſciples of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> from the reſt of Men; 'Tis from thence happened, that the firſt <hi>Chriſtians</hi> carried their Lands, and Goods, to the foot of th' Apoſtles, and ſtripped themſelves of the propriety which did belong to them; to make it Common to their brothers. A permanent ſtock nevertheleſſe of thoſe offerings was not made. They did onely paſſe, and were ſhared in Meaſure as they were received, and as in proportion the Faithfull had occaſion. The flames of Charity ſince growing by the Number of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts, and the Goods which were daily offered to the Church being extreamly increaſed by that Multiplication; It was judged expedient to preſerve the ſtock, and that the diſtribution of the Revenue might ſerve to maintaine the Paſtors, and to relieve the poor. This order was introduced even in the time of th' Apoſtles, as we may conjecture, or a little after. In concluſion, the ſtock which made a great
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:99746:59"/>ſumme was divided into proportions, &amp; the portions aſſigned to them who ſerved the <hi>Church,</hi> and conſtantly applyed to other uſes, and without being any more mingled or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded. This order hath laſted to our time; And how holy or unlawfull th' uſe of the goods of the Church hath been in th' hands of particular Men; 'Tis at leaſt not to be doubted but that the Charity of the Givers hath been precious be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, and their zeal extremely meritorious. But more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over I ſay, that after the Golden Age of <hi>Chriſtendome,</hi> and that very happy time wherein they onely knew <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> crucified; and when from the Poverty and Abjection of the faithfull, Miracles were ſeen t'ariſe: It hath not been In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient That the Church ſhould be rich. And ſince for the future the ſupernaturall meanes which have founded it, ought to be in great Eſteem with Men, God hath alſo Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented that the Church ſhould draw wealth from abroad; Advantages which ſhould render it the more Venerable; and hold the people who regard not much more then th' Exteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and are not moved but by th' objects of ſenſe, into re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect that is due unto it.</p>
                  <p>But with Riches, they ſay, a thouſand Evills paſſed into the Church; Vanity and delicacies put themſelves into the Throne of virtue: The Charity of our Fathers is become the food of the profuſion of our Nephews, and the poor dye for hunger; whilſt they that ought t'ingage their Lives for them, leave them not their Subſtance. To this I anſwer, that although they are vitious Eccleſiaſtiques, becauſe they are rich, and that in many the Licenſe of Manners growes from th' Abundance of Goods; It followes not therefore, that the Church ought to be robbed: That this is common to them with all good things, to be expoſed t'ill uſage in th' hands of wicked perſons. That the Sacraments are not to be aboliſhed, becauſe there are Men that commit ſacriledge; That God doth not deface the beauty of Nature, becauſe it ſerves for an occaſion of ſin to the weake; and no perſon is bound to pul out his Eyes when they are unchaſte, and are raviſhed by forbidden Objects and diſhoneſt Curioſities. There are Church-men ſpoiled, which would have been honeſt Men if they had not been rich; And there are whoſe Life is full of Edifying &amp; of exemplary Charity, whoſe virtue would be concealed in poverty and unprofitable Holineſs. Poverty and Riches are of themſelves a Matter without Form; They are ſuſceptible of Contrary impreſſions; They may receive the Figure of Good and Ill, and neither of theſe things hath any Merit, if Charity doth not raiſe it. But the number is ſaid greater of th' Abuſes of Riches in the Church,

To that I alſo anſwer, that, It being ſuppoſed for truth, it follows not that the <hi>Church</hi> ſhould be made poor; That God ſuffers th' iniquity of ſinners, and the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the World, for ſome virtuous Actions, that are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in exerciſed; That he makes his Sun to ſhine upon a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of wicked, for a ſmall number of Honeſt men that ſerve him; that he had forgiven ſix thouſand culpable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, if he had found Ten innocent perſons in <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah;</hi> And in the deluge which ſwallowed the World, if there had been in it ten juſt Families, He had not, it may be, made that great Example of Juſtice; So, both th' order of things, and conduct of providence perſwade us that Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ought not to be baniſhed from the <hi>Church</hi> for th' abuſes at whoſe birth they ſerve for an occaſion; ſince they are the cauſe of a number of good Actions which are thereby done; That they ſerve the beſt of virtues which is Charity; and 'tis certain that returning to the hands of ſecular perſons, they would be more dangerouſly imployed, and would cauſe more ill, and leſs good, than in the hands of Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques.</p>
                  <p>What concerns the purifying of th' Eccleſiaſtique Order, and to reſtore it to its firſt beauty, and its originall inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, 'tis a thing eaſter to be deſired than done, and which is not neither the worke of a little time, nor of the common force of men. It were to leap from one Extream to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. To paſs ſuddenly to ſuch a ſevere Reformation; It were to put new Wine into Old Veſſels, and to ſew New Cloath to a torne Garment, (following the parable of our Lord): And in driving away of Devills, the cuſtome where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of had taken away what was moſt offenſive which is the ſcandall; To introduce greater, by filling their ſpirits with ſharpneſs, and the World with Tumults. Th' Alteration is ſo generall, th' Intereſts of temporall Princes are ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded with the intereſts of the <hi>Church,</hi> and the greateſt part of men ſo faſtned to their preſent condition; That it would coſt God leſſe to raiſe the Dead, than reduce things to the ſtate of their birth, and bring back all Chriſtians to to the Aunc ent Diſcipline. It ſufficeth, That in what ſtate ſoever the <hi>Church</hi> is found, every perſon may find ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation there, If he will; and that out of it, none can avoid Damnation; 'Tis nevertheleſſe true, that as 'tis to purpoſe, that the Miracles where upon the <hi>Church</hi> hath been founded, be ſometimes renewed, and that the beliefe of things paſt be confirmed by ſome preſent Signe; ſo though the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:99746:60"/>Order hath received ſome ſtaines, and loſt its purity in ſome of its Members; God alwaies raiſeth ſome good ſouls which without forſaking of the Church, ſever from the corruption of particular Men, and expreſſe in their lifes the Image of that great Virtue, which appeared, at the birth of Chriſtianity; and which was common to the firſt faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full perſons.</p>

                     <p>I ſay then, that although the <hi>Popes</hi> of the firſt ages, had only very pure thoughts and affections of fathers towards Princes who were their Children; Nevertheleſſe ſince they have aſſumed another Quality than that whereby they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> That they have mingled th' Intereſts of the <hi>Church</hi> with them of the World.

                     <p>But when th' Intentions of the <hi>Popes</hi> which ſhould be ever good, and their Wills in an inviolable Juſtneſs: when their Zeal ſhall have no other heat then what Duty inſpires, and the Love of juſtice communicates; Their underſtandings
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:99746:61"/>may be prepoſſeſſed. They may do it with a good faith; They may wander thinking to be in the Right way and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the paſſions of their Kindred believing to ſatisfie their Charge; The ſtate Eccleſiaſtique is now governed in ſuch ſort, that the <hi>Popes</hi> eaſe themſelves of the greateſt part of their Affaires upon their Nephews.

                     <p>This proceedings, which on the ſuddain may ſeem ſtrange, is not without ground or appearance of Reaſon; Amongſt the <hi>Cardinals</hi> ſome are naturall Subjects of <hi>Princes,</hi> to whom beſides the Duty of birth, they owe alſo their fortune and alſo their promotion; and the Glory of the Purple they weare, is a Beauty which belongs not to them but by reflexion; and was borrowed by their Maſters from th' <hi>Holy Chair</hi> to be Communicated unto them. And by conſequence 'tis no wonder, If they are bound onely to their Intereſts; If they follow onely their Inclinations, and labour onely for their Glory, and the good of their Affairs; Or they are Children of ſome petty Soveraigne, and therefore full of th' humours of their Houſe; of deſire to make it Great; and in the ſame dependancy with it; To conclude, the greateſt part of them, who from a Mean or low birth attaine that high Dignity; depend upon great temporall Powers, either by benefits received, or by guift of penſions, or by hopes wherewith they hold them faſt. There's the ſtate of <hi>Venice</hi> onely, which never gave themſelves up to that practice, and which hath ever neglected to make themſelves great in the Conclave. 'Tis at no charges to gaine <hi>Cardinalls,</hi> and contents it ſelfe to Command them of their States which are never above Two at a time, and paſſe Ordinarily into ſeparated Intereſts from theirs though not Contrary. Theſe paſſions then and thoſe dependancies change the wills of <hi>Popes</hi> in regard of the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals;</hi> Make all their offices ſuſpected to him, and cauſe the Reſolution of Affairs, to be reduced to him and his Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or to ſome of his Creatures, whoſe faithfullneſs he hath tryed, and whoſe Abilities are eſteemed by him.</p>
                     <p>But that great Authority which <hi>Popes</hi> deliver up to their Nephewes, and the power of th' <hi>Holy Chair,</hi> The diſpoſition whereof they very often leave entire and free unto them, are not ever governed by pure hands; 'Tis hard, though not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:99746:62"/>that the zeal of the generall good ſhould entirely poſſeſſe them who are not publique perſons but by partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, 'Tis hard to forget ones proper Condition, and to have no Motions but of what a Man is not: 'Tis hard to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray ſelfe Love, and to ſeperate wholly from ones ſelfe, and 'tis to no purpoſe to ſhut up th' high-wayes t' intereſted De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes and to particular Ends. They will light at our Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes if we are not infinitely virtuous, by ſome ſtolen Path, or by a ſecret Addreſſe; Th' Intentions of the <hi>Pope</hi> may be holy, but th' Intentions of the Nephews may be unholy. And if that be ſo, what expedient is there to ſtay the Contagion with them, and that it infect not the <hi>Pope?</hi> What defence againſt an Evill, that admits not of Preſervatives? To an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for what one ſees, if no ſight be had but by the ſight of others? To ſee a thing as it is; if th' outſide be diſguiſed? If th' Appearances have been Changed, and if the ſellers of paint and plaiſter, who are many in great Courts, have prepared it before it be ſhewed? But to gaine ſometimes the Nephews and corrupt th' Agents employed by them, in the Quarrells of Princes; the way is open to them who can do good and promiſe Recompences. For ſo ſoon as the <hi>Pope</hi> is mounted into the throne which drawes him ſo neer to God, and placeth him ſo much above other Men; It ſeems to the greateſt part of his Relations, that they cannot with modeſty ſtay in the crowd nor in th' obſcurity of particular perſons, ſo long as th'Uncle or the Brother is encompaſſed with the greateſt Lights of the world; And therefore ſome of them are tenacious of all that may eſtabliſh the greatneſs of their houſe, and raiſe them to the State of their Ambition. The <hi>Spaniards,</hi> underſtand better then all the Nations of the world theſe practices, and have larger Meanes t' exerciſe them then any other Nation. The Penſions which they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute without Meaſure; The Livings they have to conferre in their States of <hi>Italy,</hi> and to th' Advantage of them that act at the Court of <hi>Rome;</hi> The Meanes t'advance their Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to th'Offices of Peace and Warre. Th'Eſtates which they ſometimes give them, or make the purchaſe thereof eaſie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, and Advantageous, and Rich Marriages which they procure for them; are ſtrange Engines to Shake the Probity of <hi>Italians,</hi> if it be not very well Confirmed. The marriage of the Heire of th' houſe of <hi>Jeſualde</hi> of the moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous of the kingdome of <hi>Naples,</hi> againſt th' expreſſe Clauſes of he father's Will, which <hi>Gregory the fifteenth</hi> diſpenſed in favour of one of his <hi>Nephewes;</hi> gave th' entry to the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> into the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> rendred them Maſters of that Valley under the name of another power, gave that great wound
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:99746:62"/>t'<hi>Italy,</hi> and th' Armes of <hi>Holy Peter</hi> aided there t' advance th' Ambition of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and to weaken the Liberty of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince where they are adored. And Moreover when hopes are weak to draw a perſon to their party, They then add feare; Tis not poſſible, but that th' one or th' other of thoſe Paſſions may have its Effect, and they that reſiſt their guifts and promiſes in relation to their Intereſts, are carefull at leaſt not to juſtle them, the better t' avoyd the Tempeſts which they raiſe, and the Perſecutions they ſtir up. Beſides the Reſiſtance they give them who aſpire the <hi>Pontificate</hi> when they are of a Contrary Inclination, They have yet o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Expedients to make themſelves to be feared. I will not believe that they were the Principall Cauſe of th' un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Ends of the <hi>Caraffes.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">All three were hanged.</note> The deportments where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they abuſed th' Authority of their Uncle. The Evills wherein they plunged <hi>Chriſtendome</hi> by their ungoverned Ambition: The fire which they kindled in the State Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtique, and which endangered the deſtruction of it.</p>
                     <p>In ſhort, all that a great power armed with Impunity could produce of fatall, gave but too much foundation for Juſtice, to make ſo great an Enſample. But 'tis true alſo, that the Contrivances of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and th' Ardent purſuits which their Agents made againſt them, did not abate the ſpirit of the Judges, nor the Rigour of the ſentence; But without that, the perſecution wherewith they agitated the <hi>Cardinal Aldobrandin</hi> after the Death of <hi>Clement</hi> th' Eighth, and the little ſafety he had alſo for his perſon, till he had ſuppled them by Imploring their Aide; Make out cleere Evidences how dangerous a thing it is to have been their Enemy, or not to have been for them which is allmoſt the ſame thing.</p>
                     <p>Preſently after the coming of <hi>Paul</hi> the fifth, to the Ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficate, That <hi>Cardinal</hi> found himſelfe thruſt at from ſo many places, and ſaw ſo many ſnares laid about him, and ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny plots formed for his deſtruction; that he was conſtrained to leave <hi>Rome</hi> and to retire to <hi>Ravenna</hi> whereof he was <hi>Arch Biſhop,</hi> nor did he find there the ſafety he ſought for; and th' unexpected ſtormes which there did ariſe compelled him to leave that place where he was bound to reſide, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for his ſafety by his flight. He retired then into <hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> whereby the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Savoy</hi> who knew th' originall of his Evill, and the Remedy that might heale it; who knew from what Corner the windes of the perſecution blew and the Meanes to appeaſe them; Adviſed him to Caſt himſelfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to th' Armes of the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and to employ his Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation to reconcile him to the <hi>Pope.</hi> No perſon is ignorant of the warre they made to the <hi>Cardinal Baronius,</hi> and with
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:99746:63"/>what obſtinacy they aſſaulted him for cleering the Rights of th' <hi>Holy Chair</hi> to <hi>Sicily,</hi> and for publiſhing a truth they would have had concealed. In that Treaty, where that learned <hi>Cardinal</hi> endevours to prove that the Body of <hi>St: Inques</hi> is not at <hi>Compoſtelle</hi> of <hi>Galico,</hi> They have truly anſwered with Reaſons and Proofs which much weaken the contrary opinion, and make theirs very probable who ſupport it by the beliefe of Chriſtian Nations, and ought to be known for publique ſatisfaction. But in the Treaty of <hi>Sicily</hi> they have re-parted with Fire, becauſe, it may be, that reaſons failed them, and commanded the fourth Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume of th' <hi>Annales</hi> of that great Perſon to be burnt by the hand of a Hangman, to declare the doctrine it contained, criminall, becauſe it was not favourable to them. Truly, this evidence is to be rendred, and praiſe to be given to the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> That there's not a Nation in the World which hath ſo violent jealouſie, as they, for the Intereſts of their State, and for the dignity of their Crown. And it muſt alſo be ſaid, to the ſhame of ours, that there are none ſo ſtrongly labouring under a contrary paſſion, as the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of <hi>Frenchmen.</hi> I will report the cauſes of both, in the ſecond part.</p>
                     <p>Beſides this, what did not the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in the Conclaves, where the ſuffrages enclined to <hi>Baronius</hi> ſide to chooſe him <hi>Pope?</hi> What Artifices did they leaven unattempted t'oppoſe that promotion? What Efforts did they not employ to breake it, and what Engines did they not ſet a going t'over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw it. The <hi>Cardinal</hi> of <hi>Sourdis</hi> ſtormed, and made a noiſe to no purpoſe at their practiſes; The greateſt part of Honeſt men were ſcandalized, and deſirous, to no better ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, that the Church might be governed by a Perſon that had ſo much merited from her. the wiſhes of honeſt perſons were unprofitable. They ſighed in vaine for ſo Holy an Election: <hi>Baronius</hi> his Enemies carried it, and the generall Intereſts of <hi>Christendom</hi> gave place to the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Intereſt of <hi>Spaine.</hi> Theſe Examples, and many others aſtoniſh them who upon other accounts have no Inclination for that Nation, and the fear which every perſon hath to procure himſelfe Evill is the cauſe that many are diverted from doing the good they would, if liberty were not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted, and generoſity aſſaulted by odious means and by thoſe violent wayes.

                  <p>I Do not intend t'infer from the precedent diſcourſe, that Princes ought to be deprived of the Mediation of <hi>Popes</hi> nor to reject their offices when <hi>Chriſtendome</hi> is agitated, and that It's Princes are in diſcord. I ſhould be an ill <hi>Logician</hi> to draw no better conſequences, and it were t'act againſt all the principles of Reaſon, and all the Maxims of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality; To forbid th' uſe of good things for their cauſe that abuſe them, To hinder good Superiours to do their Duty, becauſe the bad neglect it, and not enjoy the Beauty of the Sun, nor the benefits of its Light becauſe of the Eclipſes which ſometimes interpoſe, and ſteale it away from the World. 'Tis true, that there have been wicked <hi>Popes,</hi> and who have been the ſhame of th' <hi>Holy Chaire,</hi> and the ſcandall of Religion. There have been of them who did not engage in th'Affairs of Princes, but to trouble them; who brought only poyſon and fire againſt the diſeaſes, and who infected with their venome and breath, all that they touched: But all are not of that Nature, all are not guided by that Spirit. There have been ſome very honeſt Men, full of the ſpirit of God, who burn only with Holy Zeal, and having been raiſed to that ſupreame Dignity, have renounced all affections of Blood, for t'aſſume only th' affections of common Fathers of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and, of incorruptible Arbiters of th' affairs committed to them. And as they have the heart very ſound, and the will free from all irregular paſſion, ſome of them alſo have the ſight cleere, and th'underſtanding much enlightned, having a great intelligence of the things of the World, and that the goodneſſe of their underſtanding and th' Imployment they have had from other <hi>Popes,</hi> have put them into a condition, neither to be deceived by the artifices of their Relations, nor bewitched with ſtrange illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. The corruption alſo of their kindred, and of their Miniſters of State, is not ſo Univerſall, but that many are exempt, and who mingle nothing of particular with the Zeal of publique Reſt, nor any thing of Strangers with th' inſtructions of their Maſters.</p>
                  <p>And without conſidering, that th' <hi>Holy Chaire</hi> is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation wherein Religion is ſupported, and that there's no ſalvation for the members who abandon that Head; This
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:99746:64"/>Good ariſeth to the Princes his Children. That his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is much reſpected by them when it interpoſeth in their Affaires, and that his offices are very powerfull or very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to determine their Quarrells, when the fire is kindled betwixt the two great Crowns, and that <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spaine</hi> make warr. What power is either high enough or impartiall enough t' interveine to put it our? who can have force enough, to retaine thoſe two great Engines when they move, and to ſtop ſuch Impetuous and raſh Motions, but th' <hi>Holy Chair.</hi> Beſides that the Empire hath long ſtood without its firſt Glory, and without any markes of its ancient Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, but the Name, Armes; Who knows not that it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on <hi>Spaine,</hi> or is in Communion of Intereſts with it? who knowes not that it hath withdrawn th'Empire from the precipice wherein it was falling; That it ſubſiſts not but by its ſubventions and Reliefes; and that <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>fifth</hi> left not a ſtronger Recommendation to his ſon, than to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in amity with his Couſins, though their friendſhip coſt him very deer, or to preſerve it at an exceſſive price and with Immoderate Conditions.</p>
                  <p>For what concernes the Crowne of <hi>England,</hi> which was heretofore the Counterpoiſe of th' other two, and Arbiter of their differences; It is no more ſo proper, as it hath been t'Act in their diſcords. Change of Religion hath ſpoiled it, it cannot entertaine any good Intentions for the <hi>Catholiques.</hi> Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that venome on the heart, it cannot behold their proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perities with Eyes entirely pure. Their good Intelligence ought to be ſuſpected, and if it advanceth ſometimes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Spaine</hi> and ſometimes towards <hi>France,</hi> It laſteth ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and is done with ſuch languiſhing Motions and ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine a Returne; That 'tis very viſible, that 'tis not a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Amity; it conſiders but a fancy of Goodwill which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently diſappeares and an abortive of Affection which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by ſome light Cauſe; As to the Republique of <hi>Venice,</hi> It hath truly Wiſdome, and Greatneſs enough, to labour in the Quarrells of the two Crownes; But'tis ſo very Jealous of the power of th' one, and ſo great an Enemy to their Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that their Endeavours would not be leſſe ſuſpected then th'offices of a Declared Enemy.

                  <p>The <hi>Pope</hi> then remaines the ſole Mediator of their Diſcords. The Quality of Children of the Church, which Catholique Princes do Glory in; obligeth them to honour Him who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents

Thoſe Princes alſo, who are ſometimes a weary of quarrelling, and to whom th'Evills of warr are dreadfull, and the Miſery of their ſubjects gives them cauſe of Pitty, are very willing to be invited to Reſt, by ſo powerfull Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; It cannot be denyed, but that the peace of <hi>Vervins</hi> ſo neceſſary for <hi>Spain</hi> and profitable for <hi>France,</hi> was the work of <hi>Clement th'</hi> Eighth, and that <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Great</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>Second</hi> had been much troubled to lay downe Armes which weighed ſo heavily on both partyes, without ſo great an Interpoſer. I have ſaid, that when Princes are tired with Quarrells and emptied of Monies and Men, or that they have in other places more important Employments which they cannot attend but in quiting the firſt; otherwiſe truely when Ambition is ſupported by force, and when th' appetite to Conquer is provoked by th'hope of victory; Tis hard to extinguiſh it with Treaties, or to appeaſe it by offices; To the greateſt part of Princes that make warr, the ſame hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, as t'opinionated Lawyers, who ceaſe not to plead by Election but by Inſufficiency, who owe their Reſt to the poverty, and not to the moderation of their ſpirit; and who ſtop not in going, but ſtand on the way for want of Force to go further. Beſides th'Experience which we have made of theſe laſt motions of <hi>Italy,</hi> we have memorable examples in the Lifes of <hi>Charles the fifth,</hi> and <hi>Francis the first.</hi> The ſtate of <hi>Milan</hi> was the Love of thoſe two Princes, and the moſt violent objects of their Ambition. They both burned with an Equall heat of poſſeſſing it, and th' animoſity which they Conceived upon that ſubject one againſt another, was ſo great that neither time nor men could ever evercome it, <hi>Paul the third</hi> ſpared not his perſon and expoſed himſelfe to long journeies, to labour ſo neceſſary a Reconſiliation. Th' inundations of the <hi>Turke</hi> from all parts upon Chriſtians ſufficiently ſollicited th'Emperour. And nevertheleſſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of that could bend them: They reſiſted the prayers of the <hi>Pope:</hi> The miſerable Condition of <hi>Chriſtendome</hi> touched them not; and that fatall obſtinacy coſt him beſides the blood of his Children, The loſſe of <hi>Rhodes</hi> and the diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the faireſt portion of <hi>Hungary.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Popes</hi> have not onely lent their endeavours to <hi>Christendome</hi> to determine the Quarrells of thoſe Princes; But have alſo often aided in ſecuring it from the Ruine that threatned it,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:99746:65"/>or to revenge its affronts or recover its Loſſes, had it not been for their Mediations and Offices: the Proteſtants had finiſhed the defacing of it, or the <hi>Turks</hi> had ſubdued it, and God, who hath choſen them to be the viſible Cheifs of the <hi>Church,</hi> hath alſo ordained that they ſhould be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Liberators of the Country, where the <hi>Church</hi> is preſerved; and th'Inſtruments of temporall conſervation to the people that do acknowledge her. The moſt famous League the world ever ſaw was formed in the Councill of <hi>Clermont</hi> at th'Inſtance of <hi>Peter th' Hermite</hi> and by th'Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of <hi>Urban</hi> the ſecond; Four hundred thouſand fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men put themſelves under the command of <hi>Godfrey</hi> of <hi>Buillon</hi> for the conqueſt th'<hi>Holy Land.</hi> Chriſtianity never overflowed ſo largely as at that time, It never obtained ſuch Eminent ſucceſſe; and never ſo great a Number of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturers, and voluntary Souldiers were ſo long together for the ſame deſigne, and with ſo much courage.</p>
                  <p>But not to go from th' Age paſt, and from the things hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the times of our fathers; Who knows not that <hi>Paul the third</hi> was Author of the League was made betweene the <hi>Venetians</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Fifth</hi> to beat back <hi>Soliman</hi> who threatned <hi>Italy,</hi> and to chaſtiſe <hi>Barbaroſſe,</hi> who robbed the Coaſts. That if the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſuffered the victory t' eſcape which they had in their hands, if they would have taken it; If the Maritime power of the <hi>Turke</hi> was not abated at that ſtroake; If <hi>Barbaroſſe</hi> was not deſtroyed at <hi>Preveſe,</hi> as he might have been; The cauſe muſt be attributed t' <hi>Andre Doria,</hi> as I have ſaid in another place. It ſeemed, that theſe two <hi>Pirates</hi> had ſhared th' Empire of the Sea, and th' one deſired not the ruine of th' other for feare of being leſſe conſiderable to his Maſter, when he had defeated his Enemies, and to loſe credit with the loſſe of exerciſe: <hi>Barbaroſſe</hi> alſo repayed the Courteſie and gave the revenge to <hi>Doria</hi> neere <hi>Villa Franca</hi> where he would not deſtroy him, as it was eaſie for him after a Wrack, nor purſue his Ships which the Tempeſts had ſcattered. It may be alſo there was ſome hidden Cauſe, and ſome concealed Motive from th' <hi>Emperour,</hi> for which reaſon he ſought not Victory in the League we ſpeak of, but the retrayte of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, and ceſſation of the War. I will treat of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the ſecond part, in the treaty of Leagues.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth, layed the foundation of the League for the reliefe of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> which was concluded under <hi>Pius the fourth,</hi> That if it was not fortunate enough; If th' hopes conceived faild of their principall End, and if <hi>Cyprus</hi> was loſt for want of reliefe; The delayes the <hi>Spaniards</hi> bring t'all their
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:99746:65"/>undertakings; The tempeſts that were frequent that year upon the Sea; The Plague which emptied the veſſels of the <hi>Venetians;</hi> and a ſecret diſpoſition of th' Heavens, that afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Republique, were the cauſes of that Diſgrace; The League nevertheleſſe was profitable, and paſt-ages nor all the powers of th' ancients did not produce upon the Levant Sea any thing ſo memorable as the Battail of <hi>Curſolary;</hi> That, if the Chriſtians had not betrayed themſelves; If the would have made uſe of the victory, and have followed the fortune <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> and the <hi>Levant</hi> offered them; we had been largely repaired for the loſſes we have lately received. We ware Maſters of the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea, the <hi>Turke</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the Land, and the Virtue of <hi>Don John</hi> of <hi>Auſtria</hi> might have given hopes to <hi>Spain,</hi> not t'envy <hi>France</hi> the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of its <hi>Godfrey,</hi> and the good ſucceſſe of it's Armies. But the diſtruſt the <hi>Venetians</hi> had of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and th' Experience they had made under <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, in the taking of <hi>Chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teauneuf,</hi> how unjuſt obſervers they were of th' agreements of Leagues; On the other ſide, the jealouſie the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had, that the Ruine of the <hi>Turk,</hi> was the greatning of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> That they would gather the beſt pieces of his over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, and the principall fruit of the Warre; That having no cauſe to fear the forces of the <hi>Turk,</hi> they would the leſſe conſider the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> ſtrength; and becomming more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, they might the more croſſe them in their deſignes for <hi>Italy;</hi> That, I ſay, corrupted the victory and fruſtrated th' hopes of <hi>Chriſtendome</hi> and th' attempt of the World. They that know the humours of Princes, what the reaſons of State are, and the nature of Leagues, will not think that ſtrange which I have now ſaid.</p>
                  <p>However we have drawn two notable advantages from the victory of <hi>Lepantha.</hi> Th'one is, that if we have not been wiſe enough to make profit of the Good offered us, we have been ſufficiently happy in avoiding th'Evills which threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned us, if the forces of the <hi>Turke</hi> had not been ſhatter'd, and that formidable Fleet diſſipated which covered all the Gulfe of <hi>Venice</hi> with Creſcents and the lower Sea of <hi>Italy.</hi> Th' other advantage is, that we have given him to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that if his forces are greater then thoſe of a ſingle Prince; they are inferiour to the forces of united Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. And if by a deſigne worthy the name they beare, they combine together againſt him, his Greatneſſe in a ſmall time would be humbled, the Creſcent ſhattered, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſent to the bottome of <hi>Soythia,</hi> from whence he took his originall. The continuation of the League, and the good Fortune of Chriſtendome, dyed with the Life of <hi>Pius</hi> the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:99746:66"/>
                     <hi>fifth,</hi> and if his ſucceſſor had had as much Zeal as he to maintain it; He was not happy enough to ſupport it, for he had the diſpleaſure to know, that the <hi>Venetians</hi> had broken it, and was agreed with <hi>Selim</hi> without the knowledge of their Confederates; whether they had Reaſon or not, I will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe in the Second part, where I will examine the Cauſes of the Treaty of <hi>Moncon,</hi> which we made ſome yeares paſt upon the buſineſs of the <hi>Valtoline.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For what concernes the warrs at Land, Tis very well known, what <hi>Popes</hi> have done againſt the Common enemy of <hi>Christians,</hi> and againſt Heretiques. In the ſecond Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of <hi>Soliman</hi> againſt <hi>Vienna,</hi> and in th'heat which poſſeſſed him to purge off the ſhame of the firſt Expedition, It was neceſſary that <hi>Chriſtendome</hi> ſhould employ all her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; That her reſt was to be ſet up and oppoſe its greateſt power to a Conquerour, whom Spight and Ambition ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated to her Ruine; It muſt be confeſſed, that in this Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion <hi>Charles the fifth</hi> was truly the <hi>Caeſar</hi> of <hi>Christians,</hi> and that he fought for Religion in defending his patrimony. But it muſt alſo be confeſſed, that the Cares of the <hi>Pope</hi> were very ſedulous to ſend him forces; To ſolicite for him in all parts, and to put him into a Condition to receive that formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable Adverſary; So <hi>Soliman,</hi> as powerfull as he was, durſt not advance towards him; He durſt not put his Glory to Competition with that of <hi>Charles;</hi> And as religious as he was, He brake th' Oath he had made, Neverto return to <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi> but as Conquerour of <hi>Vienna,</hi> and loaden with the ſpoiles of <hi>Auſtria.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So ſoon as th' <hi>Hereſie</hi> of <hi>Luther</hi> multiplied and felt it ſelfe powerfull, It appeared rebellious. All the <hi>Septentrionals</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſtconſpired againſt th' <hi>Emperour;</hi> nothing was ever ſeen ſo proud as that League, becauſe it was very ſtrong. The Standards of the Commanders were filled with proud Mot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toes and with threatning words; And two Great perſons th' one for the warr, and th' other for th' Intricacyes of affaires, which were the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Saxe</hi> and the <hi>Langrave</hi> of <hi>Heſſen,</hi> made up the ſoul and gave it Motion. Th' Emperour in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parance ought to be ſuppreſſed with the ſtorme that ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized him, and religion to have ſuffered finall ſhipwrack in <hi>Germany;</hi> ſo truly it had hapned, if the <hi>Pope</hi> had not run to his reliefe. The forces which <hi>Paul the third</hi> ſent him under the Command of his Nephew, were the ſinewes of <hi>Charles the fifth's</hi> Army. And with that re-enforcement which conſiſted of ten thouſand choſen men; That great Leavy of men was diſſipated. The <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Saxe</hi> was taken priſoner after he was overcome; The rebellious Cities opened their Gates
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:99746:66"/>to the victorious, and the Victory was at th' iſſue the <hi>Pope</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired it; who apprehended, for th' Intereſt of religion, the progreſſe of proteſtants Armes; and th'too great proſperity of th' <hi>Emperour,</hi> for th' Intereſt of <hi>Italy;</hi> Theſe latter yeares when Hereſie overflowed at the Dyet of <hi>Wormes,</hi> and that it propoſed to change religion in all places, with the Change of States; All <hi>Germany</hi> almoſt conſpired in this Deſigne; and the forces which ought to have been Imployed againſt the <hi>Turke</hi> and for the Recovery of <hi>Hungary,</hi> were turnd againſt th'houſe of <hi>Austria,</hi> becauſe it was <hi>Catholique</hi> or too ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. The revolt of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and th'Election of the <hi>Count Palatine;</hi> The ſhew of their firſt Armes, and the weakeneſs of th' <hi>Emperour,</hi> gave feare t'other <hi>Catholiques,</hi> and raiſed the Courage of th'other Proteſtants in <hi>Europe; Italy</hi> was then threatned, <hi>Rome</hi> was alſo devoured in hopes; <hi>Babylon,</hi> ſaid they, muſt be purged, and that which had been ſo long the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall ſeat of Religion, ought to be the principall ſeat of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie; In this publique Conſternation of <hi>Catholiques,</hi> and in the feare of more tragicall Events; This Evidence is to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to th' <hi>Holy Chair,</hi> That eminent Reliefes were raiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt th' Evills which happned, and againſt them that were feared; and that the <hi>Catholique</hi> League of <hi>Germany,</hi> hath been principally th'effect of the <hi>Popes</hi> Authority and zeale. And truly it hath been ſo happy, and God ſo viſibly declared in its favour, that we ſhould be troubled to believe the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perities which happned, if we had not ſeen them; and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hath fallen out more Contrary to humane Diſcourſe, and to the ſhew of things than the Ruine of the <hi>Palatine</hi> and the reſurrection of th' <hi>Emperour.</hi>

                  <p>THough it be eaſie to inferr from the precedent Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, How neceſſary it is that the <hi>Pope</hi> interpoſe in the Quarrells of Princes, and that he be made the Mediator of their Diſcords; Tis eaſie alſo to conclude with what cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection their Agents are to be treated with. Another Miniſter of State then, treating with them, ought never to be free from diſtruſt; which aſſures buſineſs; which avoydes ſnares; which defends from ſurprizes, and leaves not deceit in the power of deceivers. That he takes it for Certaine, That they are perſons who bring Art to all they do and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:99746:67"/>deſcend t' Action but well prepared; Who are Enemies t' Impetuoſity, and ordinarily have no violent paſſion which Confoundes Diſcourſe and diſorders Reaſon; That of all th' humours whereof the body is compoſed, eſteem no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo much as Flegme; nor of all the virtues that enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to affairs, as Patience for to tire them: He ought to know, that they loſe nothing, and make profit of all, That ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they go back, to advance the better; That the laſt thing they diſcover, is their firſt Intention. That they turne the back, where they would ſalute; as they do, who row: And though the ſtraight lines are the ſhorteſt, they love th' oblique better t' attaine their Ends, and to hit the Mark they propoſe to themſelves.</p>
                  <p>He ought then to be prepared againſt their Art and againſt all their Cringes: But he muſt in ſuch a manner regulate his behaviour and governe himſelfe with ſuch a Temper, that he never make Diſcovery of his Diſtruſt; That he make ſhew of free deportment, and that th' outward Appearance make out nothing but freedome. He muſt fortifie th' En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries of Conferences with th' opinion he hath of th' Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity of him with whom he treats, of th' uprightneſſe of his Intentions, and of the purity of his zeal for the publique Good. He muſt give him alſo a taſte of His Maſter's Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, If he be our friend that he may obſerve it, or that of his family, if it have paſſion for us, that he may not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from it. From this open Action and free proceeding in ſhew of deſigne and artifice, of three things one will ariſe; either Impreſſion will be made on his will; an Entry on his ſoul; or an Inſinuation into his Inclinations, which will be an augury for us, of the good ſucceſſe of th' affair. Tis a point which they ought ever to aime at, who manadge buſineſſe, and that they may aſſure themſelves, that ſo ſoon as they have gained the will of any perſon, they become Maſters of his reaſon, and underſtanding. 'Tis ſtrange what power the ſecond Faculty of the ſoul, hath, which is, to ſpeak truth, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but heat and affection, above the firſt Faculty, which is Light and Intelligence. When ſhe pleaſeth, ſhe drawes her by whom ſhe ought to the guided; ſhe makes her walk after her deſires, though ſhe ought not to moved but by her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes; She makes her find painting and dreſſes, for th' ug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things ſhe hath Love for, ſhe makes her diſguiſe, under th' appearance of true, a lye which ſhe will follow; and under th' appearance of Good, th' injuſtice which ſhe will practiſe, This rule ought inviolably to be obſerved in all Negotiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that they may be happy, That they benot manadged by perſons that have averſion for one another. The ſecond
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:99746:67"/>is, that if the perſon with whom one hath to do, ſtands firme and ſuffers not himſelfe to be ſhaken by that kind of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and compleaſancy. If he reſiſts that charme and catch not at that bit, He will be the leſſe on his guard when nothing ſhall be ſuſpected by him. He will be eaſier taſted, he will breathe out ſome words to manifeſt his thoughts, and it may happen to him as to ſtrong places and well provided for, which are ſometimes loſt by too great confidence had in their Forces, and by the little care is uſed to preſerve them, believing that there's no need of it; To conclude, if ſome profitable uſe be not made of this Conduct, the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe which attends an open Diſtruſt, at leaſt, will be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed which is ever injurious to him in whoſe behalfe it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed, which would raiſe in him ſharp thoughts againſt us; and would draw th'Inconveniences we would avoid; or divert the ſucceſſes which we believe, not t'owe to the Good-will of another and to his induſtry, but to our ſubtelty, and to our addreſſe.</p>
                  <p>Two things alſo are to be remembred, Th'one that th' Art which I adviſe is not Art, if it be not concealed; and that it workes an effect contrary to what a man propoſeth to himſelfe, ſo ſoon as it hath taken Aire. This ſo benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall confidence then, is to be expreſſed without affectation and exceſſe. Otherwiſe truly, when it makes a noyſe and is irregular, when it ſpeaks loud, and makes its action too preſſing, 'Tis ſuſpected of ſome deſigne; it engenders diſtruſt and creates a beliefe of the contrary he would perſwade, And in this particularly, That excellent Rule in Logicke is to be obſerved; <hi>That who proves too much proves nothing, or that good word of th' Antients, That nothing be done too much,</hi> or that advice of <hi>St. Paul, To be wiſe to ſobriety and with meaſure.</hi> Th'exceſſe of complements wherewith the Court is infected and th'Irregularity of <hi>Tatling</hi> which receives neither excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion nor bounds, are certaine proofs of what I have now ſaid. So there are none but fools and new commers, that delight in it; able perſons believe ordinarily the contrary, and ſeek the truth of intentions in the contradiction of words. Th'other thing particularly to be obſerved, is, Not t' employ this Art indifferently, and to all th' uſes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto is proper; Not to make uſe of it t'aſſault, but to defend ones ſelf; Not to deceive, but to ſecure from deceit; and not to make a poyſon of what ought to be a preſervative. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this ſenſe, 'Tis alſo true, that diſſimulation is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, &amp; <hi>That whoſoever knowes not how to Diſſemble, knows not how to Reign.</hi> The foundation of this opinion is, that though lying be forbidden, &amp; that it is a thing unworthy of man, &amp; a
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:99746:68"/>villanous perſpective in his demeanor; That the exteriour ſhould contradict th' Interiour; That the Tongue ſhould bely the Heart, and that the Word ſhould betray the thought, whereof 'tis th'Image and Character; 'Tis ſo, That no perſon is bound alwaies to declare his ſenſe, to retayle all that is in the ſoul; To make the firſt commer his confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor and his Judge, and 'tis certain that God hath as well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended ſilence to us to conceale Dangerous truths, as he hath given us ſpeech to publiſh the Neceſſary Truths.</p>
                  <p>The diſſimulation which tends to the Ruine of ones Neighbour, and ſerves for a cover to injuſtice, ought to be ſhunned of honeſt people. And what gaine ſoever it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth, and with what hopes of recompence 'tis attired; She cannot repaire th' evill of the breach of the bond of publique Faith, and of overthrowing the foundation of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Society; 'Tis a falſe prudence which th' <hi>Ancients</hi> have condemned; which the light of nature deteſts; which takes away credit from man, and makes even his good Actions to be ſuſpected. In a word, it deſtroyes ordinarily them that make uſe of it, and thoſe double ſpirits and ſubtile mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are often ſeen to fall into the ſnares they have prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for others, and into the precipice they have digged for them. They who teach this doctrine, and make ſcience of deceit, propoſe examples, which are capable to divert a Man, and the tragicall ends wherewith ſhe is diverted make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear; That when the juſtice of men failes, God at leaſt failes not t' interpoſe his juſtice; To catch the Wiſe in their Wiles, and the Cautious in their Malice. The conduct of <hi>Caeſar Borgia</hi> which was the Modell of <hi>Machavell's</hi> Prince, and that villanous Original whereof he made ſo dangerous a Copy, had in the beginning ſome conſiderable ſucceſſe; But God who had permitted that perſon to be borne in his wrath and to puniſh the ſins of <hi>Italy,</hi> and to be the Flayle of them that were leſſe wicked then himſelfe; abandoned him at laſt to juſtice; Took his judgment from him for deſtruction, permitted that no faith ſhould be obſerved to him who had ſo often broken it; That he who was ſo diſtruſtfull became Credulous, and was blind to the Nets the great Captain laid for him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Italy,</hi> as it is the Theater of great vices and vertues, gave a little before another great Example of the ſame nature. <hi>Lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick Sforſa</hi> believed himſelfe the ſubtilleſt perſon of his times; His Picture and Deviſes retained ever ſome marke of that vanity and all his entertainments are filled with that folly. He made profeſſion to lead the great perſons of <hi>Europe</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:99746:68"/>he liſted; To have in his hands the Peace and Warr of other Nations, and to have been more powerfull with his wit and addreſſe, then the Conquerours were with their Force and Armies. It hapned at laſt, that he who had overthrown the peace of <hi>Italy,</hi> wherein ſhe repoſed, to ſatisfie his ambition; who had ſo often broken his Confederacies and Alliances; and had opened the way to Soveraignry by Poyſon and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricides; that he, I ſay, beſides the great Diſgraces which vexed his Life, was betrayed at <hi>Navarre</hi> by the <hi>Suiſſes</hi> that were payed by him; ſold to the French that made warre with him; Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned in the Tower of <hi>Loches;</hi> and for ten years together ſerved for a ſpectacle to all <hi>Europe</hi> of the frailty of greatneſs, and of th' Inconſtancy of worldly things.</p>
                  <p>Our Hiſtory is not unfurniſhed of illuſtrious examples in this ſubject. <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Navarre</hi> who had neither Faith nor Religion; who was the Firebrand of <hi>France</hi> and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall diſturber of its reſt; who ſo often played upon the eaſineſſe of the people with his Eloquence, and ſo often a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed the gifts of the Spirit which were admirable in him, t' afflict this Kingdome; with how many evills did he ſee himſelf purſued? His Quality of Prince did not exempt him from poverty nor priſon; He was eaten with long and ſharp ſickneſſe, and at laſt Fire conſumed him by th' Impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of a ſervant, with a Cloath wet in Aqua-vitae. The Conſtable of <hi>Saint Paul</hi> ſubſiſted long in the diſſimulation he compleatly practiſed: but in long running his Art ruined him, and deſiring to make uſe at one &amp; the ſame time of two contrary parties, He was ſo deſerted by th'one &amp; ſacrificed to th' other. Truly if deceits and wicked wayes were not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to violent accidents, and to ſuch fatall concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, th' Ignorance, or Corruption of men is very ſtrange, to help of nature the wayes of reigning, and to deſtroy their affairs which they might find more certain, and honourable with prudence and diſcourſe; what pitty 'tis that ſo many experiences which have preceded cannot make them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that if vertue be ſometimes unhappy, 'tis alwaies eſteemed; That it riſeth oftner then Malice, when it falls, and that the good fortune of this conſiſts not in the ſouls of them that exerciſe it, but in th' opinion of them, that behold only th' Exteriour which covers it, and the ſuperficies that doth ſurround it.</p>

                  <head type="sub">Whether it be lawfull to make Warre with the Pope; Wherein the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour which Phillip the ſecond, obſerved in the Warre he made is Commended, and that of Charles the fifth Condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</head>
                  <p>TO reſolve this matter well, and give it a full day and a perfect Cleereneſſe; 'Tis neceſſary to make uſe of the Metaphyſicall abſtractions, and to diſtinguiſh the things which are effectively joyned with the Spirit; But are truly diverſe, and have nothing of common but the ſubject which holds them, and the ſtock on which they are grafted. The <hi>Popes</hi> then are not now to be conſidered as Vicars of Jeſus Ghriſt, Who hath proteſted that his Kingdome was not of this world, but as <hi>Princes of th' Earth, and Lords</hi> of certaine States in <hi>Italy</hi> and in the country of <hi>Provance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That being ſuppoſed, I ſay in the firſt place; that it ſeems that they who have given theſe Eſtates to the Church could not beſtow them with other Intentions, than as they did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy them, and ſubject to the ſame inconveniences they were in the time of their enjoying them. And therefore the <hi>Popes,</hi> which enjoy them are not exempt from the right of Nations, no more then the firſt Maſters of thoſe eſtates, and that they ought to propoſe to themſelves; Beſides, that injuſtice is more odious in them then in other perſons, who ought t' act only by charity; 'That 'tis permitted t'other <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignes</hi> to do Juſtice themſelves, when it cannot be obtained of them, and that they abuſe to the ruine of men, to tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall power they have received from men. So when <hi>Paul the fourth</hi> declared War againſt <hi>Phillip the ſecond</hi> and would take away the Kingdome of <hi>Naples</hi> from him, to give it t'one of his <hi>Nephewes;</hi> Th' adviſe of the moſt eminent <hi>Theologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans of Spaine and Flanders,</hi> and amongſt others of <hi>Melchior Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Porta,</hi> was; That he ought not only t'attend in his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, the <hi>Popes</hi> Forces, and beat them back; but that he might alſo with a good conſcience enter upon the Lands of the <hi>Church</hi> by way of diverſion, and to prevent the ſtorme which was raiſed againſt his Territories.</p>
                  <p>I ſay, nevertheleſſe, that here diſtinction muſt be uſed, and 'tis very probable, that a Warre purely offenſive againſt the <hi>Pope</hi> may not ſingly be undertaken; That there's no title of juſt Warre, nor conſideration of State, which can diſpence a Prince to retaine with conſcience, what he hath gained in juſtice from th' <hi>Holy Chaire,</hi> and that conſequences are not
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:99746:69"/>to be drawn from what intervenes in the Commerce of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces purely temporall, and in the Quarrels they have toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in relation to what reſpects the good of the <hi>Church,</hi> and the Revenue of <hi>St. Peter.</hi> The Reaſon is, that inſomuch that amongſt the firſt, 'tis ſufficient that the Warre be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably juſt t'authoriſe the conqueſts that are made, and make the poſſeſſion lawfull of what is gained. Which happens not in the Warres that are made to <hi>Popes.</hi> To make out the true difference, 'tis of importance to ſtay a little upon this dolefull matter, and to deſcend even to the Root of that juſtice, and to the finall cauſe which makes the Warre law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. The Soveraign Princes who have no ſuperiours on Earth, who hold only of God by themſelves, and are inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent as to all other men, are dependent as Juſtice. And therefore ſo oft as they violate that Vertue, and break that Divine bond, which ſuſtains th'Order of the World; Another Prince which ſhall be wronged, may repaire himſelf of the wrong he ſuffers, and ſatisfie himſelfe with his own hands. And in this, Conſcience is ſafe, and the Warres, mads to repulſe violence, are agreeable to God, and the bloud there ſpilt a ſacrifice of a good Odour before his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majeſty. Wherefore in th' Antient Law he hath ſtirred up his people t' Arme themſelves, and to fight; and he hath not diſdained amongſt his moſt Magnificent Qualities and moſt glorious Titles t' aſſume that of <hi>God of th' Armies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This at firſt ſeems ſtrange by reaſon of th'Inclination Man ought to have to ſweetneſſe and peace; And ſince 'tis not ſeen that Beaſts are greedy of the bloud of their kinde, nor <hi>Tygers</hi> cruell againſt <hi>Tygers;</hi> There's cauſe of great amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that men ſhould be ſo ingenious to deſtroy one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſo fierce to ruine their very kind, That the nobleſt of all Virtues is Valour, and that of making warre the moſt famous Art. That the glory of <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Caeſar</hi> needed two Millions of Lifes, to riſe to th' heighth it is at; And that ancient <hi>Rome</hi> allowed not the triumph but to the Murderers of all moſt a whole Nation, and to them who had depopu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated a Country of the Flower of their Inhabitants, and pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out the Nobleſt bloud of a Province. That would truly be ſtrange, if it was done by an Inſtinct of Cruelty, If it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from a blind Envy, to drinke up humane bloud; and was conducted by any other ſpirit then that of Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice.</p>
                  <p>That if we make no Queſtion to take Phyſicke, To permit opening of veines, and to make uſe alſo of Poyſon, and of fire t'heat our bodies; How much leſſe difficulty ought we
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:99746:70"/>make t' imploy violent Remedies when gentle are unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and that there's no other proviſion to be made againſt th' Irregularities of Princes and of people, nor to Maintain juſtice which is th' health of States, and the ſoul of the poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique Body. That if what ſoveraigne Princes practiſe in the perſon of their ſubjects, and the Example they make of their Crimes are, agreeable to God, and neceſſary for the world; How much more ought that to be juſt, which they exerciſe againſt other Princes, and is of the more Generall faults, and concern all the Nations of th' Earth in Conſequence, &amp; an infinite of particular perſons in their private Intereſt. It were well to be wiſhed, That of two parts which Compoſe the diſtributive; The world knew onely that which gives Crownes to virtue, and Recompences to Merit: But ſince Corrupted nature enclines more t' evill than to good, and that th' objects of virtue are not ſo frequent and active, as thoſe of vice; That part of juſtice, which diſtributes puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, hath by Conſequent a more neceſſary uſe and more extended then th' other; and <hi>Soveraignes</hi> ought no more to be exempted, then particular perſons, ſince they are alike faulty, and more dangerouſly Culpable. 'Tis the reaſon God hath put the ſword into their hands, and hath Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that they ſhould have power to puniſh, not onely the Criminalls of their ſtates, but alſo to revenge th' injuryes done them, and require reaſon themſelves of other <hi>Sover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aignes,</hi> which had offended them, ſince they have no ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, as particular perſons who do the wrong.</p>
                  <p>I ſpeak here of the wrongs which one <hi>Soveraigne</hi> doth to another; For what concernes the <hi>Soveraigne</hi> to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, tis a buſineſs which other Soveraigns have nothing to do with, but to behold; as not ſubmitted to the Juriſdiction of any perſon, and what God hath reſerved for his Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and for his Juſtice; when the power is Legitimate th' uſe may be violent, without being Lawfull, for any perſon whatſoever t' alter it with force. The people who are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, have nothing but prayers to divert it, or Patience to ſuffer it; Beyond that, theres no Reſiſtance juſt, nor excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be admitted. The Duty regardes not the perſon of Princes, but th' Authority God hath put into their hands. The bad as the good poſſeſſe it; and therefore he wills, that we acknowledge them equally, and reverence, as th'Image of his power, them whom we cannot love as th' Image of his bounty. The reſult of what hath been ſaid, is, that a <hi>Sover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aigne</hi> may ſometimes ſtrip another <hi>Soveraigne</hi> without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice; That the ſtates of th'one, may be the price and matter of Reparation for another that hath been offended;
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:99746:70"/>or of th' Expence which he hath made in the purſuit; and that there's nothing Committed, againſt th'order of things, if Innocent ſubjects ſuffer for the faults of their Maſters. That they partake of his Evills, as of his Benefits and receive the badas good influences of the head whereof they are members. But for what concernes <hi>Popes</hi> and the Patrimony of th' <hi>Holy Chair,</hi> The Conſiderations is very different; They have Priviledges which are not Common t'other Princes, nor t'other States. God extends to them a Certain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, by reaſon of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> for whoſe Love they have been given, which renders them unalienable, which are not to be uſurped without ſacriledge, and above the Right of Nations, and thoſe univerſall Lawes to which all Nations have conſented for the Generall Good of the world. And tis not alwayes true, That the things which change Maſter cannot change Condition, and take the Qualities of the laſt poſſeſſor which they had not with the former; If the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters attract the virtues of the Mineralls by which they paſſe; If the goodneſs of the ſoile communicates it ſelfe to the plants which are brought thither, and gives them a grouth they had not in another; If the proprieties of a Crowne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend upon the Members which are united to it; And if <hi>Bretanny</hi> be ſubject to the <hi>Salique Law</hi> ſince it was incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated into <hi>France;</hi> why ſhould not the dignity of th' <hi>Holy Chair</hi> infuſe ſome what of particular to the States which are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to it? Why ſhould it remaine Barren? why ſhould it be without virtue and action in that behalfe? Why ſhould not <hi>Holy</hi> things have ſome exemption above the prophane? and the Reflexion which is made towards <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſome Reſpect from <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Princes, which they give not t' one another, and ſome ſpeciall Diſtinction.</p>
                  <p>I ſay, in the third place, when the <hi>Pope</hi> quits the functions of his Charge; and that, of Father (which he ought to be) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes th' Enemy of his Children; when he breaks unjuſtly the Calme of <hi>Chriſtendome,</hi> and carries the warr to the States of other princes, They may preſerve for their defence, and make uſe of th' offenſive by way of Diverſion and preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; provided that neither th' one or th'other tend to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, but onely to Conſerve, and paſſe not the deſigne of a lawfull Defence. So the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> did exerciſe it in the warr he made againſt <hi>Paul the fourth.</hi> He ſtayed not to make his defence juſt, till th' Eccleſiaſtique, and <hi>French</hi> Armies were joyned and made Incurſions into the Lands of his Maſter. He drew into the field whilſt they were preparing; Enterd the Lands of the <hi>Church,</hi> took many places, and gave Terrour to <hi>Rome.</hi> And if he would have forced the Victory
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:99746:71"/>as farr as he might, he had ſeen it crowned with the taking of the Chiefeſt Towne of the world. But his deſigne was t' affright the <hi>Pope,</hi> and not to hurt him; To ſhew lightning, and reſtraine the Thunder, to conſtraine him whom he could not bend, and to bring him back to his duty by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, who voluntarily eſtranged himſelfe from it; So after we had received affronts before <hi>Civitella,</hi> and before other places by the fault of the <hi>Caraffes;</hi> After that our Army was Conſtrained to draw back and might have been defeated, If the <hi>Duke of Alva</hi> had been diſpoſed to have gained bloody Victories, and not to have prepared bridges for his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. In their Retraite, He made an Accommodation with <hi>Paul</hi> and an Accord, which I preferre before the greateſt Victory <hi>Spaine</hi> ever obtained. He reſtored all the places he had taken. He confeſſed his error. He was at <hi>Rome</hi> to make his ſubmiſſions to the <hi>Pope;</hi> He demanded pardon for the fault'he had committed; ſo <hi>Rome</hi> received him, as in Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph; He had th' honour t' eate with his Holineſs, and merited of his bounty the praiſe of being the defender of the <hi>Holy Chair</hi> whilſt he made warr with it; And ſince when af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſix yeares of ſervice, and for a matter of nothing, as I have elſe where expreſſed, <hi>Philip the ſecond</hi> ſent him a Priſoner to his houſe in the Country; <hi>Gregory the third</hi> interceded for him, and endeavoured to gaine him his Liberty. In the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting to him the long and great ſervices, which he had rendred to <hi>Spaine,</hi> and to the Church, and particularly the Moderations h' uſed in behalfe of th' <hi>Holy Chair,</hi> when it was in his power t' have defaced ir, unpuni ſhed; to make uſe of the priviledges of a Conquerour, and t' exerciſe Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, which force gives to them that have it; This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding is worthy of th' Approbation of all Ages, and th' Imitation of all Princes.</p>
                  <p>Th' Action of <hi>Charles the fifth</hi> in the ſame ſubject, is very different from th' other. Let us repreſent it as it is and in its naturall poſture. Lets take away the policies and paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wherewith the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have diſguiſed it; Lets not flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a Monſter which cannot be formed too hideous, and that ſo ſcandolous and black a Crime reſt not unpuniſhed in the Memory of Men. I am Content that the taking of <hi>Rome</hi> by <hi>Bourbon</hi> ſhould be taken to be a Blow from th' hand of God, and an effect of his provoked Juſtice, and that the warr inclined it to that ſide againſt th' Intention of <hi>Charles;</hi> and that Treaty which <hi>Moncado</hi> made with <hi>Clement</hi> was done without ſupecery, and with Deſigne to Cauſe it to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by <hi>Bourbon,</hi> and to ſuffer the <hi>Pope</hi> t' enjoy the Truce of five Months, which had been accorded unto him; And that
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:99746:71"/>th' Army of <hi>Bourbon</hi> took the bridle in the teeth, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched towards <hi>Rome</hi> in ſpight of his Generall. I ſpeak not of the raiſing of 14000 furious <hi>Lutherans</hi> and burning with the firſt Zeale of that Hereſie, t'employ them in a Warre, where th'<hi>Holy Chaire</hi> had ſo great a part: But after that <hi>Rome</hi> was taken, &amp; that dreadful accident was hapned by the courſe wherewith it was guided; After that th' <hi>Holy Citty</hi> had ſerved for ſpectacle to the World of the juſtice, and of th' Impiety of Men; After that the <hi>Pope</hi> was beſieged in the Caſtle of <hi>St. Angelo;</hi> Why did not th' <hi>Emperour</hi> cauſe the ſcandall to ceaſe at the firſt news he heard of it? Why did he not deliver <hi>Rome</hi> of that heretique Garriſon, which abuſed th'holy things; who prophaned the moſt ſacred Myſteries, of our Religion; and added to all the kinds of cruelty, all the kinds of ſacriledge. Why did he ſuffer the <hi>Pope</hi> to be put to Ranſom, to redeeme himſelfe with Money from the vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of victorious Heretiques; and that <hi>Oſtia</hi> and th'other ſtrong place: of th' Eccleſiaſtique State, were the Price of his liberty, and th' Arguments of his ſervitude. I know well, that ſome anſwer may be made in his favour and for his diſcharge; That 'tis permitted to make uſe of th' Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; which we have not ſought, but fortune hath of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd; That 'tis lawfull to draw good from th'evill which happens againſt our intentions; That 'tis the deſtiny of the things of this World, That the proſperity of ſome is raiſed by th' Adverſity of others; and that th'affairs of State are like thoſe of Merchandize, wherein the greateſt ſecret is to know when to make right uſe of the time, and t' employ th' occaſions to profit when they are offered. To that I anſwer; firſt that the evills which I have ſpoken of, and thoſe dreadfull Accidents, were the ſequells of the breach of many treaties made with <hi>Clement,</hi> and of the violation of publique faith in his perſon. And therefore, that the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects could not become Lawfull, whoſe cauſes were ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly unjuſt; That the River cannot be very ſound, if the Spring be poyſoned; That concluſions retain alwaies the conditions of the principles f<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

In the ſecond place I anſwer, that the perſon of the <hi>Pope</hi> and the dominions of th' <hi>Holy Chaire</hi> are priviledged-things and of right are not ſubject t' all th'Inconveniences, and t' all the diſgraces to which the Perſon, and States of other Princes are expoſed; for the Reaſons above given and which ſhall not here be repeated.</p>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:99746:72"/>
                  <p> As to th' affliction th' <hi>Emperour</hi> ſeemed to declare, at the News of th'Accident, and the Demonſtrations he pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed of an eminent grief; As to the mourning he put on to make his Diſpleaſure viſible; and to the Proceſſions he made upon that occaſion; And the Rejoycings for the birth of his Son, He cauſed to ceaſe; To weep, th' ill fortune of the <hi>Pope;</hi> All that, was but illuſion and Comedy. So that falſe ſadneſſe ſuddenly diſappeared, and that vain ſhew of griefe was preſently belyed by the proceedings above mentioned. And moreover <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt reproached him in one of his Manifeſts; that he had dared to think to ſend <hi>Clement</hi> into <hi>Spain,</hi> and conceived that monſtrous vanity, To have at the ſame time in his hands, the two principall perſons of the World, and two ſo great priſoners as a <hi>Pope,</hi> and King of <hi>France,</hi> The <hi>Spaniards</hi> anſwerd that if <hi>Charles</hi> had had the will, who could have hindred him, to have executed it? And who are ſtrong enough to oppoſe his deſignes, in a time when Fortune refuſed nothing to his deſires, when his proſperities gave feare t' <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> was amazed at the blow which it had newly received. When <hi>France</hi> was mortified for th'Impriſonment of its <hi>King,</hi> and th'heretiques of <hi>Germany</hi> made brags of the purging of <hi>Rome</hi> from its abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, and abating the <hi>Pope dome</hi> under th'Authority of a Catholique <hi>Emperour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To that, Anſwer may be made with <hi>Francis the first,</hi> That <hi>Charles</hi> was diverted from that deſigne by th' Horror the propoſition raiſed to all <hi>Spaine.</hi> That the people murmured and the Clergy raged, when there was ſpeech of leading the Vicar of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> in Triumph, and to make a Priſoner of th'head of the <hi>Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though it be very hard to juſtifie the truth of this fact, &amp; to make viſible a matter ſo darke; 'tis better to leave it in darkneſſe, and to ſuſpend herein ones beliefe, for the honour of a Prince that hath much merited of the <hi>Church</hi> in divers occaſions, and to whom the glory of beating back <hi>Soliman</hi> cannot be denyed, and th'aſſuring of all <hi>Christendome</hi> in the defence of his patrimny, and the States of his brother. At leaſt, 'tis certain that if he was a ſinner, he was a Penitent; and that he waſhed his faults with the teares of three years, which he poured out in his retraite from the world, before death tooke him away from it.</p>
                  <p>Others aggravated this fault by th'Evills which Fortune raiſed t'interrupt his proſperities, and by the diverſe faces which ſhe ſhewed to them of his Race. They mentioned the diſgraces of his Brother, The Route of his Armies at <hi>Ezechio,</hi> and at <hi>Bude,</hi> and th'other Victories which Valour
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:99746:72"/>did not ſo much give to the <hi>Turk,</hi> as th' ill Fortune of <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand,</hi> and the Cowardiſe of his Captains. They did not conceale th' occaſions wherein he ſaw his deſignes over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown, and his perſon in danger; The ſinking of his Fleet in th'haven of <hi>Algiers;</hi> and that fearfull loſſe, which hath not been equalled by any loſſe made by Chriſtians on the Sea, but by that, which his Son made in the Sleev of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> They repreſent the ſucceſſe which the ſecond League had againſt him in <hi>Germany:</hi> The Chaſe which <hi>Maurice</hi> Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> gave him; And the neceſſity whereunto he was reduced, to ſave himſelfe by night, and the ſixth perſon at <hi>Iſburg,</hi> and to conſent to the peace of <hi>Paſſo</hi> ſo inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to <hi>Religion,</hi> and ſo unworthy of th' <hi>Empire:</hi> And to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, they adde th' ill ſucceſſe of the Enterprize of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance,</hi> and the ſhame of the ſiege of <hi>Mets,</hi> which was the laſt deceit fortune put upon th' <hi>Emperour,</hi> and th' accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the deſigne he meditated to put himſelfe out of her power in quitting the World where ſhe is ſo ſoveraign. I will not affirme, that all theſe Evills befell him in revenge of the ſacking of <hi>Rome,</hi> and th' affront offered to th' <hi>Holy Chaire.</hi> It might happen that God ſent or permitted them for that ſubject; And it might fall out alſo, that they ſprang from other reaſons, and were th' effect of another cauſe. Inſomuch, that according to the judgements that are made upon that Matter, and th'Examples which are alleadg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of them whom God hath puniſhed for offending of <hi>Popes;</hi> There's more in it of opinion then of ſcience, and of conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture then certitude.

The Death of <hi>Bourbon</hi> of the firſt inſtances given is not ſo concluding an Example, nor ſo demonſtrative as 'tis believed, againſt what I have now ſaid. I deny not, but that God might have permitted it as the puniſhment of the ſacriledge he commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in forcing <hi>Rome,</hi> or as the vengeance of the breach of a Treaty whereupon <hi>Clement</hi> truſted, and whereof the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation had been often repeated unto him to ſurprize him. But I know alſo that the violent end of that Prince might proceed from a cauſe meerly accidentall, and th'ordinary fruits of a profeſſion which ſpares no perſon, and where Musket ſhot makes no diſtinction betwixt private Souldiers and Generalls of Armies. It might alſo happen; that if the juſtice of God did particularly conſider that death; It was to correct a man whoſe Revolt did ſo much evill to his
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:99746:73"/>King, and coſt ſo dear to his Country; or more likely as a Revenge for <hi>Lombardy</hi> which he deſerted to be ſpoyled with Gruelties and Rapines, and not to ſuffer his perjury to paſſe unpuniſhed when he promiſed <hi>Milan</hi> t'eaſe it of the Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that devoured it, and to draw from it willingly, the laſt drops of its bloud, and what remained in it of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>

                  <head type="sub">The defence of <hi>Gaſton</hi> of <hi>Foix</hi> against them, who ſay that God pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed him for making warre to <hi>Julius</hi> th' <hi>eleventh;</hi> with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of that Prince, and of the great Captain.</head>
                  <p>I Am ſorry that <hi>Gaſton</hi> of <hi>Foix</hi> is placed amongſt th' Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples whom they ſay God hath puniſhed for having made Warre. The reſpect I bear the vertue of that Prince; The great things he did in his very youth, and the value ſome Lords of <hi>France</hi> have with me; being of his bloud, and who have with him the ſame Originall, are the cauſes that I will defend him here of Calumny, and averre that he had the Nobleſt Death and moſt glorious Life for the time it laſted, that Hiſtory makes mention of, or fame doth publiſh; 'Tis certain that <hi>Gaſton</hi> made warre in a time when the Nations of Chriſtian Princes were confuſed, and their paſſions very different for th'Intereſts of th'<hi>Holy Chaire. Julius the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,</hi> who was then in the Chaire, ſeemed to have forgot what he was; and to have renounced the Quality of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Father to make himſelfe, Head of a party; or at leaſt Member of a League formed againſt <hi>France;</hi> The jealouſie he had to ſee us in the heart of <hi>Italy;</hi> The implacable hatred he bore to the <hi>King,</hi> and the effects whereof he had made him to feel in the perſon of the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Navarre,</hi> whoſe king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome he had interdicted; Obliged <hi>Lewis the twelfth</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare againſt the Tempeſt that threatned him, t'exerciſe the Right of Nature, and t'oppoſe force to force, and to repaire to counſel to ſtop the violencies of th' Armies of th' <hi>Holy Chair,</hi> which <hi>Julius</hi> had on foot, nor t'heal but to kill; not to edifie, but to deſtroy.</p>
                  <p>In this occurrence, when the Right ſeemed to be of <hi>Lew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is</hi>'s ſide, <hi>Gaſton</hi> had the command of th' Army in <hi>Italy.</hi> And though the ſubject ought not to diſcourſe upon the deſigne of his Maſter', when he ought to follow without enquiry whither he goes, and that the Law which ought to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, doth not alwaies declare the vertues of what it or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dains; <hi>Gaſton</hi> executed the orders of the King in a cauſe
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:99746:73"/>evidently lawfull. To whom he owed obedience, even in Matters whoſe right had been ambiguous, and juſtice doubtfull; That if he were ſlaine at the battell of <hi>Ravenna,</hi> and periſhed in an Occaſion whereunto no perſon goes not to dye, but t' overcome, as he did, The chance of Armes hath ſo ordained it, and his Death was the more noble, that it encounterd with his Duty, and that he was ſlain in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of his Charge.</p>
                  <p>I ſspeak not at this time of other Circumſtances, which make his death glorious. To dye at th' age of two and twenty yeares, being almoſt aſſoon Captaine as Souldier; having almoſt at the ſame time put forth flowers, and brought forth fruits; after a Number of Victories whereof none were ſmall, and the leaſt might have laid a foundation, of Reputation for an eminent perſon; and in the midſt of a proſperity ſo conſtant, that it was never in the power of fortune t' interrupt it; and ſo ſuddaine and Impetuous, that ordinarily the laſt ſucceſſes troad upon the former without Interruption, and the newes followed one another without Intervall. Add to this, th' Eſteem his virtue had gained when he dyed; the feares and hopes it diverſly occaſioned in the world; and the contrary paſſions it produced in equall degree in the ſoules of his Friends and Enemies. It was ſuch, that the <hi>French</hi> could not rejoyce in the Battell they had gained, becauſe that Prince dyed there. That <hi>Lewis the twelvth</hi> wiſhed the like Victories to his Enemies to ruine them; and, what is moſt eminent and remarkable, That it forced <hi>Ferdinand</hi> of <hi>Caſtille</hi> to reconcile himſelfe to the great Captaine, and to withdraw him from that Reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redneſs to which a jealouſie of State had confined him, to ſend him back to <hi>Naples</hi> and t' oppoſe <hi>Gaſton,</hi> if he had long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger lived; That it conſtrained an old Man, and a Soveraign-Prince to ſuppreſſe ſo imperious a paſſion, and to reſtore t' Imployment one of his ſubjects whoſe greatneſs was in jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly with him. To dye in that high Reputation, and go out of the world, before tryall was made of the Revolutions of it; If it be a ſtroak of vengeance from Heaven, and the price of ſome great Crime; Let generous ſoules, that have th' appetite for Glory, and ſome Reſentment of honour, be Judges of it.</p>
                  <p>Since we have ſaid that <hi>Gonſalve</hi> was to paſſe into <hi>Italy</hi> t' oppoſe <hi>Gaſton,</hi> and that <hi>Ferdinand</hi> had deſigned him that Great adverſary, if he had out-lived the journey of <hi>Ravenna;</hi> Lets obſerve a little on whom in that warr th' advantage might have reſted, and on what ſide the victory have leaned, in a Difference where the Parties were ſo equall.</p>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:99746:74"/>
                  <p> It may not peradventure be amiſſe to divert the Reader with pleaſure, and t' entertaine him with a piece not unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, though of no relation to the work. <hi>Titus Livius</hi> hath ſometimes done the like amongſt th' Ancients, and <hi>Paruta</hi> amongſt the Modernes, and I cannot be much blamed in th' Imitation of them, nor t'have failed after two ſo great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples. Tis true, that the ſubject which I ſhall treate upon is extreamely ambiguous and much troubled. If it be never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe lawfull to ground ſome judgment upon the future, and to caſt our eye upon the thing collected, Tis proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that the virtue of <hi>Gonſalve</hi> had given place to that of <hi>Gaſton;</hi> that it had given him the field; and that fortune would not have abandoned a young ſervant, that knew how to make uſe of her favours, for a perſon that made no eſteem of it, and was compelled to retire in the midſt of Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The long time that had paſſed wherein <hi>Gonſalve</hi> had not made warr, and the great Ceſſation, in a profeſſion that affords alwayes ſomewhat to be learnt; had without queſtion much changed him from what he was: And as Iron ruſtes, when it is not handled, and Aire corrupts, that is long ſhut up and putrifies; ſo th' Art of making warr is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learnt, if it be diſcontinued; and military Abilities are weakened, if they are not exerciſed.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Age that hath the property to take away the good ſenſe, and to ripen prudence; hath alſo the defect to freeze the blood, and the ſpirits, and to weaken th' active Qualities, which are the Chiefeſt principles of Execution, and the neareſt Cauſes of Victories. Inſomuch that the Coldneſs of Age, if it have nothing but experience, prevents ſometimes the committing of faults, but not alwayes the ſuffering of Loſſes, and is not capable of Enterprizes that are not happy, becauſe they are bold; nor of Certaine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes wherein there's leſſe need of Circumſpection then of Courage. We have alſo ſeen a great number of Brave perſons whoſe Age hath taken away their Reputation, and whoſe Glory hath been effaced by long Life. We have no example of this truth more viſible then that of <hi>Marius.</hi> His valour accompanied alwayes the diſpoſition of his Temper, It entertained it ſelfe in his faireſt yeares, and fell in the fall of his body, and in the cadency of his Age. It hath alſo been obſerved, that the greateſt part of Conquerours, and van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhers of Nations, did not attaine th' Age of ſixty yeares; and that Many of them have finiſhed their dayes much ſhort of that time by naturall death, or by a precipitated or violent End. <hi>Caeſar, Charles the fifth, Francis the firſt, Henry the fourth,</hi> and the laſt <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Orange,</hi> failed betwixt fifty and
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:99746:74"/>ſixty yeares. And one of theſe ſtayed not to give over buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, till he was in Condition no longer to retaine it; nor to give over his greatneſſe, till death would have taken it from him; But by a Prudence, higher then that of the world, and by Motives more generous then thoſe that had made him t' undertake ſo great things; He quitted the functions of th' Empire, t' exerciſe them onely of a Man; and choſe rather t' end his Life in th' humility of a Religious perſon, then with th' Ambition of a Monarch.</p>
                  <p>The Prince of <hi>Parma,</hi> who had th' honour, to give Life to the Military diſcipline of th' Ancients, and to advance that faire work which the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> had finiſhed, dyed at th' age of Eight and forty yeares. And 'tis true, That his Glory began to decline, that th' affaires obeyed him no more, as they had before done; and that his laſt deſignes had neither the good fortune of Event, nor the grace of Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution as the former had; <hi>Alexander, Germanicus, The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis of Peſſary,</hi> and <hi>Don John of Austria</hi> have encountred the ſame period of Life, and a death almoſt alike. All four paſſed not the Age of thirty and three yeares; and all four fell ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Malice of others, and with great ſuſpition of poyſon, then by the fault of their Complexion or by open force.</p>
                  <p>This rule nevertheleſſe is not ſo generall, that it admits not of Exceptions; and there all valours, which reſiſt the Ruine of the body, and th'injuries of Age they maintaine themſelves in ſpight of the Time. Inſomuch, that 'tis not the blood that heats them, but reaſon that enlighteneth them; And without ſpeaking of the preſent Age, the paſt hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced a Conſtable of <hi>Mountmorancy</hi> and a <hi>Duke of Alva,</hi> who have preſerved an entire Reputation to the very extremity of Age; whoſe laſt actions have been the Crownes of the firſt, and the Concluſion of life, the glory of all the reſt. This nevertheleſſe is very pure, and tis otherwiſe true, That fortune hath been pleaſed to favour young Captaines, when they were wiſe againſt th' old, who have not the Courage ſo active, nor the Virtue ſo violent. And by conſequence there's ſome apparance, that ſhe would have declared for <hi>Gaſton,</hi> and been of his party againſt the <hi>Great Captaine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly the great Captaine came to the Government of an Army whoſe officers and ſouldiers were ſcarce known unto him, nor had th' army other knowledge of him then his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation and Glory. Inſomuch that 'tis a Queſtion, if there had been any Sympathy at leaſt at his firſt comming betwixt th' head and the Members, whether their Manners, had agreed, and the Proportion had been adjuſted to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:99746:75"/>and obedience. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> he came to Command an Army ſhattered and of unfortunate Troops; and he was neceſſitated at the ſame time to fight the deſpaire of his ſouldiers, and the boldneſſe of his Enemies. On the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary <hi>Gaſton</hi> was in Exerciſe, and in breath, and the warr he carried into the kingdome of <hi>Naples</hi> had been but a Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent of his good fortune, and the Continuation of that. He newly finiſhed moſt happily in <hi>Romagna:</hi> He exerciſed a Soveraigne power in his Army: He had th' heart of all his Souldiers: they loved him as their Companion, and reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him as their Generall: His beauty and good faſhion, and the other Graces of the body which render virtue the fairer, and in an age when they make ſtrongeſt Impreſſion, and have an action more lively: His beauty that was extreame and juſt; that was neither exceſſive, nor retentive; who knew how to give much, and to diſtinguiſh of Perſons; who obliged honeſt Perſons, and contented the covetous. His Courteſie was capable to compell his Enemies to change their paſſion, and ſo wiſh him in the practiſe of it; Th'Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence wherewith he changed the ſpirits of Men, prepared Courages for him as he would have them; and brought Moderation t' impetuous ſpirits, and boldneſs to the fearefull. All thoſe Qualities, I ſay, together, might give him hopes to lead his army as farr as humane force could go, and he ought not to have propoſed any difficulties to himſelfe but impoſſibilities.</p>
                  <p>Briefly, Th' opinion the ſouldiers had of his Fortune and Virtue, and th'Experience they had ſo often made of Th' one and th' Example he had given them of Th' other; Enabled them to dare all dangers under ſo valliant a Commander, and t'hope all good ſucceſſe under ſo happy a Commander.</p>
                  <p>From all theſe Conjectures, I conclude very rationally, that the death of <hi>Gaſton,</hi> hath been the good fortune of <hi>Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalve.</hi> That if <hi>Gonſalve,</hi> deſerved to be compared to <hi>Scipio,</hi> That our Heroique <hi>Gaſton,</hi> if he had lived long, had deſerved preference to both of them. And if the greatneſs of things he ought to have done, were to be judged by them he had done; That none of th' ancient Captaines had ſurpaſſed him in the Glory of Armes, and that He had ſurpaſſed all the Moderne Captaines.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Are, Labour, and Vigilancy, are not things purely ſpirituall; The body ſeems therein to have the beſt part, and if they derive their Originall from th' underſtanding. they determine in the matter, and ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble objects do bind them; They are the neereſt cauſes of execution, and without them a Miniſter of State may peradventure be wiſe, but can never be happy. On the contrary; there's no difficulty, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance which may not be forced by their aide; with them fortune is conſtrained to follow; Good counſells are aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; Bad are corrected; Things are ſupported and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown; and that form is almoſt given to buſineſſe which is propoſed; 'Tis then of great Concernment to neglect no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that may be profitable, That no accident is to be eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ſmal, if it may incommodate; That every moment ought to be of precious eſteem, if it be neceſſary for us. And that the <hi>Maxim</hi> of Morality be remembred, <hi>That evill is raiſed out of the leaſt defect in things; and that Good to be ſuch requires that every part be entire and ſound.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Above all, in great misfortunes, &amp; in the violence of fortune
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:99746:76"/>that all advizes muſt be heard; and all things attempted, though they ſeem impoſſible; For then, much muſt be ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarded, provided that it be not all, unleſſe we are conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereunto, and cannot ſave our ſelves but in ruming a courſe to deſtroy our ſelves. Moreover, we ought t' Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the <hi>Wiſe Phyſitian,</hi> who will never ordain dangerous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, and whoſe operation is doubtfull, but they will trye diverſe, of whoſe goodneſſe they may not be fully aſſured but that they ſhall not kill if they heal not, and will not make th' evill worſe if they do not eaſe it; In a word, 'tis not to be believed what great and incredible effects are produced by an exact care, by a conſtant diligence, by an infatigable conteſt, and by that prudent inquietude which alwaies acts, which forgets nothing, which never gives it ſelfe liberty, and forceth at laſt what holds too faſt, and draws what will not follow.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Caeſar</hi> was incomparable in theſe Qualities, as in all other that forme a great Captain. No perſon ever took more pains in the Warre; or exerciſed more functions together in his Army, nor that more deſired to be preſent in all occaſions, or that was more obſtinate t'execute his reſolutions, not to retire when he was once advanced, and not to ſtand in the midſt of an enterprize; 'Tis true that he deliberated much before he undertook any thing, and did not caſt himſelfe blindly upon any deſigne; He did not prepare to make war after he had begun to make it; The proviſions anſwered alwaies to the time, he had forecaſt to make them continues and th'execution never deceived his providence. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that he loſt not a moment of time, nor an occaſion of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, and never remitted to the next day what he might execute the ſame day. He ſeldome truſted but to his eyes and judgement, and for the moſt part he went in perſon to view the Country he would aſſault, and th' enemies he was to fight. When th' occaſion preſt, he made incredible Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. He paſſed Rivers by ſwimming, t' avoid going about to gain Bridges; He croſſed the Seas in ſmall Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels to make the more diligence, and choſe rather to ſayl in Storms, then ſuffer his buſineſſe to run hazard; and to put his perſon in danger, rather then his fortune: And it muſt not be a wonder, if in his profeſſion he left all the men in the world behind him; And if it hath been doubted, To whom the victory had remained, if <hi>Alexander</hi> had made Warre to the growing Common-Wealth; No Queſtion can be made but he was inferiour to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> who deſtroyed it in its moſt vigorous Age, and in th'exceſſe of its force, and made it fall from th'height of its greatneſſe, and from the top of its Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</p>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:99746:76"/>
                  <p> On the contrary, the reaſon why the Reputation of ſo many Men, is ſeen to paſſe with the time, and their glory t' extinguiſh; 'Tis the diminution of Labour, and the default of Vigilancy; This diminution &amp; default proceed from ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall cauſes. The firſt is, that as in the condition of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſons, a mans fortune doth not alwaies advance with equall pace, and with an uniforme progreſſe; That it ſtops toward th' end or moves ſlowly, though it come with impetuoſity and ſwiftneſſe: Inſomuch that he who burnt with impatience in the beginning to quit poverty, and laboured with Zeal to become Rich; So ſoon as his deſire is ſatisfied, and that he ſees himſelfe in plenty, H' abates of his cares, and would enjoy with reſt th'fruits of his induſtry. So the man whoſe ſpirit is poſſeſſed with the paſſion of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and meditates the great actions which do beget it; when he hath attained his end; That he hath filled the World with the reputation of his vertue, and hath formed in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe a great opinion of himſelfe; Th' hunger of honour which preſſed him at firſt, becomes moderate; and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent, his firſt conteſt weakens, and his ordinary dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence diminiſheth.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond cauſe of this diminution, is Age; and 'tis no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if the body which deſtroyes it ſelfe grieves the Soul; and if it operate not with the ſame vigour, as it did, when th' Organs are ſpoyled, and th'inſtruments of uſe weare out; This rule nevertheleſſe is not abſolutely true, and hath its exceptions, as I have ſaid elſewhere.</p>
                  <p>A third cauſe are the diſeaſes; which produce the ſame effects, and more dangerous then Age, becauſe they produce them more ſuddenly, and with more violence; and 'tis not poſſible, that in the griefe of the body, and weakneſſe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, a man can intend things, that are without him, and at the ſame time conteſt with the diſeaſe and buſineſſe. Beſides, what hath been ſaid before of <hi>Phillip the ſecond,</hi> The <hi>Spaniards</hi> have alſo obſerved, that their affaires in the <hi>Low Countryes</hi> declined with th' health of the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Parma,</hi> and began to change when he began to be ſick; and nevertheleſſe being of a very vaſt ſpirit, and active humour, He would not abate any thing of his accuſtomed occupations. He would do more then he could. He would retain the ſame authority in buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as when he had his health. He could not eaſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon the cares of another, and thought that nothing was well done, but what was done by his Orders. When he was hurt before <hi>Candebu;</hi> He put the command of th'army into the hands of his Son; and in regard he was but a young Prince, and to whom experience was wanting, and that ſort
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:99746:77"/>of Capacity which comes not from ſtudy, or nature; He would ſupply that defect by his Counſells; Th' Army was at <hi>Iuetot,</hi> and the father at <hi>Candebu</hi> where he was dreſſed of his wound? There he would be Conſulted with upon all Occurrences, and th' order for what was to be done was fetched a League off. In the mean time, the time paſſed in going and coming; the ſtate of the warr changed Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance; new Accidents demanded new Counſells, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> loſt faire occaſions t' inomomodate us whilſt they went t' aſke his permiſſion, and we made no ſmall advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the Diſorder of a body, that was ſo diſunited from th' head that governed it.</p>
                  <p>But to make the benefits of Vigilancy the better t' ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, and th' operations of that ſharp virtue, and of that unquiet Prudence, which is ever in Action, which makes profit of all things; that ſuffers nothing t' eſcape, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in the warr where occaſions ſtay not and never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, when they are once fled away; Lets demonſtrate this by apt examples; When <hi>Gaſton</hi> of <hi>Foix</hi> drew to the Reliefe of <hi>Bonlogna</hi> againſt th' Army of the League which had beſieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it; If at th'entry of the Towne, he had drawn out to Charge th' Enemies, he had ſurprized them; He had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated them without reſiſtance, that had not been on their guards becauſe they diſtruſted nothing; and the delay of one night which He gave at the Requeſts of his Captaines for ſome reſt to his ſouldiers, raviſhed from us a victory which had all <hi>Italy</hi> for price, and coſt us a little after the Life of that prince which was of more vertue then all <hi>Italy.</hi> Th' evening before the battell of <hi>Jury,</hi> The late <hi>King</hi> had taken his quarter at <hi>Menoncour;</hi> The <hi>Marſhall</hi> of <hi>Charters</hi> was to diſcover it, and obſerved that his Army was weake and affrighted; <hi>Sr.</hi> of <hi>Maine</hi> nevertheleſs would not Charge that evening t' untire his ſouldiers, who were hareſſed with the Labour of the way, and with the long Marches they had made; in the mean time three thouſand foot, and Eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred horſe, arrived in the night to the <hi>King,</hi> who gave Courage with th' hopes of victory to his Army, and after prevailed for the gaine of the Battell; which they run ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard the day before to loſe.</p>
                  <p>As to th' Important victories, which Care and Diligence have occaſioned, and have as it were forced from the hands of deſtiny; I obſerve three famous ones amongſt the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern</hi> and which ought to be obſerved with a particular at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. The defeate of <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt before <hi>Pavy</hi> is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, a work of th' Emperours fortune, and of the virtue of the <hi>Marquis of Peſſary,</hi> who was one of the chiefe
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:99746:77"/>Commanders of his Army. But it ought chiefly to be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to his Induſtry, and to that Indefatigable and hot humour which never gave him any Reſt, which held him in perpetuall action; which exerciſed him day and night, and forced buſineſs t' obey him, and to come to the point he had propoſed to himſelfe. In that manner He overcame us againſt all ſhew of Apparance, and got the better of us, though we had then no need of any thing but patience t' overcome; That we had nothing to do but to defend our ſelves, and t' hinder being defeated for to defeate them: Firſt he did beat downe the Forts which covered our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and rendred his Avenues ſafe; He advanced towards us without loſſe of time, or taking of reſt, and before almoſt we could ſee them come. He fell into the <hi>Kings</hi> Quarters, and conſtrained him to fight, and to put t' hazard what he had aſſured, if he had kept his advantage. On the contrary theres no place of excuſe for <hi>Francis,</hi> nor palliate his blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and that ſtupid negligence, wherewith he was poſſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the midſt of his Army, without knowing the State or Number of it, but by the report of his Captaines; and not knowing the deſignes of his Enemies, till he was not in a Condition to break them, and not being prepared to reſiſt them but believing them too weake t' aſſault him. A notorious fault in Warr, wherein the neceſſity of fighting ſhould never be permitted, nor t' act at the pleaſure of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; where they ought never to be deſpiſed or eſteemed weake; where th' Eyes ought to be imployed on all things, and nothing neglected, and where ſmall Accidents are ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily the beginnings of great Revolutions, and th' origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of the good, or bad ſucceſs of Enterprizes. The ſecond Example is of the laſt <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> when he defeated th' Army of <hi>Germans</hi> which came to overcome <hi>France</hi> under the Command of the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> and of the Baron of <hi>Auneau.</hi> So ſoon as he had diſcovered th' Army he never allowed in any reſt, and loſt not an occaſion of Incommodating it; He gave it Continuall A larmes to tire it; He had it in his Braine, when it Marched; He vexed it in its Quarters. He cut off the wayes of Proviſions from all ſides, and at laſt in three encounters at <hi>Vimony,</hi> at <hi>Auneau,</hi> and at <hi>Mount beliart,</hi> diſſipated the whole Army.</p>
                  <p>The third Example is, the Reliefe of th' <hi>Iland</hi> of <hi>Rhé.</hi> It muſt be acknowledged that the glory of that ſucceſs, which will appeare another day a Miracle in the life of the <hi>King,</hi> or a fable in Hiſtory, is an effect of the piety of that Prince, and a viſible Argument of th' Inclination which th' heavens have for him; But it muſt be alſo confeſſed, that this good
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:99746:78"/>fortune was not given him freely, and that he hath aided th' Hands of God to work this wonder; The feaver hath newly left him: His recovery was yet uncertaine, and it was neceſſary for his Courage to compleate the ſupport of his body when he put himſelfe into the way to find th' <hi>Engliſh:</hi> what he did in an Occaſion apparantly deplorable, may be judged by his accuſtomed Actions, which were alwayes of greateſt difficulty; And though th' Actions of <hi>Princes</hi> reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble th' Eſſences which containe a great Virtue in a ſmall Quantity; and though they do little, yet operate much by reaſon of the force of th' <hi>Example;</hi> So it is that the <hi>King</hi> would not have believed his Charge to have been diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged but in doing more then th' others. If he had put them onely on their way, to let them after that march of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; had he not alwayes ſerved them for guid; If he had not made way for them without Interruption; and if he had not been the laſt to quit labour and to retire from Action. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over it muſt be further avowed, that as in th'affaires where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we now ſpeak, He hath forgot nothing of the duty of an Active, and labourious <hi>Prince,</hi> and that he hath alſo there Compleately ſerved; ſo that th' Inſtruments which he there imployed, betrayed not the virtue of the principall Cauſe; <hi>Monſieur</hi> his <hi>Brother</hi> made his firſt Armes there very remarkable, and the beames of that riſing valour have been ſo lively and pure, that it was viſible they could not proceed, but from a ſpring extreamly faire, and that greater beginnings could not be expected from the ſon of <hi>Henry the fourth,</hi> and from the <hi>Brother</hi> of <hi>Lewis the juſt.</hi> As to <hi>Sr. the Cardinal,</hi> tis certaine that he brought unto the work an extraordinary Conteſt of body and ſpirit, and that the cares and diligence He uſed in that Occaſion were incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as th' effect that did ariſe from them. He manadged it in ſuch fort, as a ſick perſon is handled, to whom ſo little of life remaines, that the leaſt ſiniſter Accident that befalls him, deſtroyes him; and the leaſt things forgot of what might be Cordiall, would kill him. Two hundred poſtes diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched in leſſe then two Months, ſo many orders given, within and without the <hi>Kingdome;</hi> no advice neglected, that had any apparance of Good; ſo many veſſells got together in ſo little Time, and ſo many proviſions made for the revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctualing of the place beſiged. In Briefe, all that humane In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry hath of Inventions; All that prudence hath of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct: All that diligence hath of activity, and all that Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage hath of boldneſs, employed in this Occurrence; are th' Infallible proofs of what I have ſaid.</p>
                  <p>But t' act in this Manner; It imports that a ſoul be
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:99746:78"/>extreamely free, and have no paſſion but for his duty; That it be not divided, and 'tis not too much, that it employes all its forces in Occaſions whereunto enough cannot be brought, and wherein th'Affairs are but imperfectly done, if any other Inclination divide them; That if we have ſeen great perſons, as <hi>Caeſar,</hi> burne with Love and Ambition and done incredible things; That if he gave himſelfe up to the pleaſures of ſenſe, and to the conqueſt to the World; It was that thoſe two Paſſions never entred into conteſt in his ſpirit, nor diſputed of the Victory; and when the laſt appeared, the firſt gave it place, and left the field free; yet 'tis not poſſible, but they ſavoured of the relation, and that the contagion of th' one could not but offend th'other. This hapned even to <hi>Caeſar</hi> as incomparable he was, and the Love of <hi>Cleopatra</hi> had once almoſt deſtroyed him, and had coſt him with his Life th'Empire of the World, If he had not by ſwimming, paſſed the <hi>Nile</hi> to ſave himſelfe. But that <hi>Sr. the Cardinall</hi> hath this Liberty of ſoul whereof we ſpeak, I have elſewhere ſhewed, and therefore unneceſſary to be here repeated.</p>

                  <p>'TIs a ſtrange Hazard, and a hard neceſſity to be ſhut up betwixt two troubleſome extreams, and of two evills which preſent themſelves joyntly, to chuſe the leaſt. This laſt is a thing which all the World deſires to do, and for which Nature hath imprinted in us a violent and ſharp inſtinct. The leſſer Evills appeare good when they are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervatives from greater, and phyſick is good by reaſon of the diſeaſes it is ordained againſt. But to know how to make uſe of ſo dangerous a Compoſition, to know how t'hold the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance ſtrait, that is filled with venemous drugs, and whoſe odour ſtrikes into th'heads of them that hold it; and to diſcerne of things, whoſe quality aſtoniſheth the ſenſe and confounds the judgement, if it be not accompanied with Courage; 'Tis not th'Effect of an ordinary prudence; 'Tis not employed with leſſe difficulty though with more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſancy
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:99746:79"/>pleaſancy when good things are to be compared amongſt themſelves, and to diſcover the difference; when the ſpetious things are to be diſtinguiſhed from the profitable; and them that have weight in them, from them that make a ſhew; when we are to be exerciſed amongſt the Careſſes of Fortune, and the favours which ſhe offers us, to ſtop at the greateſt of them.</p>
                  <p>I have obſerved two places amongſt many others in the Life of the King, where, as I conceive, he hath divinely proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered in theſe two kinds of <hi>Prudence,</hi> as he hath made moſt wiſe choices upon the Counſels which have been propoſed. Th' one upon the Counſell <hi>Sr. the Cardinall</hi> gave to paſſe part of th' Army into th'lland of <hi>Rhé,</hi> to fight th' <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who without that had been Maſters of it. T'expoſe of one ſide thoſe brave Troops and Choyſe Souldiers; ſacrifice ſo much Nobility whereof there were Princes; To ſend poor Boates againſt a Fleet of great Ships. It ſeems truly to have hazarded much, and to give up too much to For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. But alſo on th' other ſide, who ſhall conſider that the loſſe of our Troop: was not infallible, but that th'loſſe of th' Iland was if they had not paſſed, That the remedy was dangerous, but that there was none other t'heal the diſeaſe, and that one part of the State was ready to be divided betwixt Domeſtique Rebellion and forrain Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, if th'Iland had not been relieved; muſt confeſſe that this Counſell was not leſſe commendable in the ſpring than in the ſucceſſe. If it was very bold, it was intirely neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and one could not only not do better, but it could not have been well done if it had been otherwiſe done.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Th'other obſervation</hi> is in reſpect of the Counſell, which <hi>Sr. the Cardinall</hi> gave to haſten to <hi>Languedoc</hi> after the taking of <hi>Zuſa;</hi> It muſt truly be confeſſed, that then there was a neceſſity to make a defence againſt the moſt ſubtile attempt &amp; faireſt ſhew of good, which might have ſeduced an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding if it had not been very ſtrong to make reſiſtance. <hi>On th' one ſide the State of Milan</hi> was in prey, and that beautifull Countrey which heretofore gave ſo much love and jealouſie to two great <hi>Princes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">To <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt, and to <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth.</note> which coſt <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> ſo much Bloud, and put <hi>Chriſtendome</hi> ſo often into a Combuſtion to know who ſhould have it; was ours without reſiſtance. It depended upon the <hi>King</hi> in apparance to become Maſter, and to take revenge of th'affronts which we have received there, and of the five times that they had driven us by force out of the Countrey. It was unfurniſhed of men of War, and there was but ſome miſerable Troops, that had eſcaped at the ſiege of <hi>Caſal,</hi> and which the ſole report of our Armes
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:99746:79"/>had overcome. All the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> made us tender of their Aides, and believed that th' Hower was come to take away the Fetters from their feet, and deliver their Country from the yoak which was not naturall to it, and from that violent Domination whoſe ſhadow was dangerous t'all its Neighbours, and weakned their Liberty if not oppreſſed it; The <hi>Emperour</hi> was diverted againſt the <hi>King of Denmarke</hi> and he could not draw his Armies from thence without abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his Victories, and without betraying his good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Spain</hi> had neither Men nor Moneyes; It was aſtoniſhed at the loſſe their Fleet had newly ſuffered; it ſaw powerfull preparations in <hi>Holland,</hi> which threatned the Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and a formed tempeſt which it could not conjure down: In a word, <hi>Milan</hi> loſt, <hi>Naples</hi> could not be preſerved; and <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> would have been loſt of it ſelfe, in ſhutting up that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, from whence it received its principall ſupplies to make Warre. And nevertheleſſe this great power which gave fear to ſo many powers, which was formidable even to the <hi>Turks and Barbarians of Affrica;</hi> which is fatall to the reſt of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Nations, which obliged all of them to be with us or againſt us; Had been beaten with that ſingle ſtroake, and we had nothing more within to fear when the ſprings of our troubles had been ſtopped without, and the Inſtruments broak which make and nouriſh our diviſions, and humbled th'Authors or Promoters of our civill diſcords. Theſe were the thoughts that in that time exerciſed the ſpirits of many perſons, and particularly of th' <hi>Italians;</hi> and as 'tis the cuſtome of men t'accommodate their thoughts to their intereſts, and to flatter themſelves in their deſires, they imagined that ours were like theirs; Though in that poynt, our Intereſts were diſagreeing. But alſo on th' other part, who ſhall conſider that men muſt not ſpend their time about ſetting their haire, or paring their Nailes when th' Heart and the Brain are ſick; That great States never periſh by a <hi>Forraign</hi> violence, ſo long as th' Interiour is in health, and th'Entrails ſound, and that they ruine of themſelves when the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is within, and th'Evill hath ſeiſed upon the Noble parts: That in long Warrs abroad, a <hi>Prince</hi> ought not t' engage himſelfe when the Diverſion is ever ready within, and that ther's a formed feaction in the middle of the State, which will not fail to diſturb for to prevaile of th'Occaſions. That the diſcontented will foment, if they dare not publique aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, and to whom ſtrangers will give heat, or forces to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbus by our ſelves; For to conſume us at eaſie Chargges and alwaies to weaken us either by loſſe or victory; Who
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:99746:80"/>ſhall conſider, I ſay, theſe things, will avow that the Returne of the <hi>King</hi> into <hi>Languedoc</hi> was a ſtroake of the gaine of the deciſion of our Domeſtique Affairs &amp; the good of Forraign Affairs. Furthermore, Could a greater misfortune befall us, then to loſe the occaſion of finiſhing the Ruine of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that hold <hi>France</hi> in Languiſhment more then ſixty years, &amp; had reduced it to a State equall to that of certain perſons, who know not what health is; but are alwaies buſie either t'heal th'evills they ſuffer, or to preſent them they feare. The conjucture paſt; It was probable it would not returne of a long time, and that 'twas to no purpoſe t' hope or expect it; It was ſo contrary to that party, that it could not but be relieved from <hi>Germany,</hi> that laboured to defend its proper Liberty; That <hi>England</hi> was wearied in protecting an ill cauſe; That th' <hi>Hollanders</hi> durſt not irritate <hi>France</hi> openly by reaſon of th' uſe they have of it; and that they have lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to regulate their Charities by their Intereſts, and the Zeal of Religion by the Zeal of State: That the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had greater action in <hi>Flanders</hi> &amp; <hi>Italy,</hi> than they could maſter; and could not act againſt us, but with a little Money, &amp; with vain promiſes.</p>
                  <p>In the third place, The Reputation of the Kings Armes was incredible, it could alone make conqueſts; It could o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome without fighting, and never Prince was better ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of his Souldiers, or more feared of his Enemies. Our Souldiers were in heat and full of hope. The paſt victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries were certain arguments of future, and after the taking of <hi>Rochell,</hi> &amp; forceing of <hi>Suza,</hi> overcomming what was defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Sea and covered with mountains; They ought not t'apprehend any thing impoſſible, nor any thing difficult. It was then the only proper ſeaſon to defeat that party which <hi>Sr. the Cardinal</hi> moſt judicially obſerved, and the King moſt divinely made choyce of. If that expedition had been longer deferr'd the plague alone had been ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to force us from <hi>Languedoc,</hi> and to defeat our Armies; and if we had been engaged in <hi>Italy</hi> what had not <hi>Monſieur of Rohan</hi> don with the Aid of ſtrangers, which had not failed him? If the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who ever promiſe timely and almoſt without deliberation; who performe ſlowly, and after long conſultations; but who ſpare nothing when they are well engaged in a buſineſſe, and have put thoſe that ſerve them in a condition not to be able to repent, or unable t' unſay it; If the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> I ſay, had performed the conditions of the Treaty they had made with him, and furniſhed the Money they had promiſed. If the forces of <hi>Savoy</hi> had paſſed into <hi>Danphine</hi> to joyne with him as the reſolution was
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:99746:80"/>taken; If ours had been divided within and without the <hi>Kingdome,</hi> and if th' hope of Change and Expectation of a better fortune, had withdrawne from their duty, them of that party which feare retained; He had without doubt broken all our deſignes, becauſe they were deſtitute of its Advantages; fruſtrated of forraigne promiſes; Aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned of the ſoundeſt and moſt Conſiderable party of <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonotes</hi> in the poverty of all them that aided him; and in the diſtruſt of ſome, and irreſolutions of others. In certaine Corners of a Province where he commanded, He gave ſo much trouble, that the preſence of the <hi>King</hi> was neceſſary and ſix Armies to reduce him.</p>
                  <p>Moreover 'tis a great diſcourſe to ſpeak of the Conqueſt of <hi>Milan,</hi> and to renew beyond that Mountaines the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our fathers; Tis a deſigne which well deſerves Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration before it be attempted, and requires another Conjuncture, than that wherein we are found; For who is ignorant, that tis not for the good of <hi>France,</hi> nor th' Intereſt of <hi>Italy,</hi> that the <hi>King</hi> be <hi>Duke of Milan?</hi> Who knows not that, our Conqueſts, if we ſhould Maintaine them, would give greater jealouſie to the <hi>Princes</hi> of that Country, then the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination whereof they complaine; That they eſteeme us worſe Maſters, and more dangerous Neighbours then the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> are more Conformable unto their <hi>Flegme</hi> and ſeverity, than our Heat and Licenſe. That they believe that we are a more certaine and aſſured Counterpoyſe to th' Ambition of others than they would be to ours; That the facility we have to make our Armies deſcend into their Countrey, and th' aboundance of men to relieve them, might give the deſire of undertaking and uſurping it; That th' occaſion ſtirres up the moſt lazie, and raiſeth the moſt ſleepy; That preſent objects do raiſe all the faculties; and that Commodity and Conveniency provoke th' Appetite of Conqueſt which is otherwiſe moderate and quiet. And though th' Ambition of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> hath neither Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion nor bounds; That they deſire violently and deſire Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things; That in th' order of their Counſells which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther change nor dye, They have declared the warr t' all Nations, which hold not of them by ſubjection or depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency; ſince this End is immoveable, &amp; that they are troubled onely in finding juſt Meanes t'attaine it; and that they ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times take ſuch as are not juſt, when others faile, ſince of a long time they have made love t' <hi>Italy</hi> That they can no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger diſſemble their paſſion; that for ſome yeares paſt, they have put off their Maſk, and made it known that they muſt
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:99746:81"/>have it, and enjoy it, though they ſhould raviſh it; ſince they are not ſo poor of Men as they have been, ſince <hi>Germany</hi> is for them, &amp; that they have at their devotions that great ſpring of Men of warr, ſo it is that th' <hi>Italians</hi> ſee well, that the victories of th' <hi>Emperour</hi> have no deep roots, That its proſperities do yet ſhake; that them he holds, make great attempts t'eſcape him; That the <hi>Turke,</hi> it may be, will make him one day quit his hold, if he make an Accommodation with the <hi>Perſian,</hi> or ſome <hi>Christian</hi> powers, that his ruine may not be ſo ſtrange, as the Greatneſſe to which he is arrived; and that in his Fall the wonder will not be ſo great, as it hath been in his Riſing; In Briefe, that he cannot live allwayes; That th' Empire may paſſe into another Houſe that may be Contrary to his; That may hate the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> That would purge <hi>Germany</hi> of their Garriſons, and at th'End of th' Account they ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the greatneſſe of that power which in concluſion will devour them. Inſomuch that th' <hi>Italians</hi> will be ever glad that we have a way open into their Country, not for to ſtay there, but to relieve them when they are aſſaulted, and if that little Liberty which remaind unto them be offended, they would have us love the walke, but not the ſtay; That we become the Rivalls but not the Maſters, and that we have jealouſie not for poſſeſſion, but t' hinder others from taking of it; Beyond that, it muſt not be hoped that they favour us, or that they be not Contrary to us, and we ſhall labour in vaine if we labour not for them, and leave them not our Conqueſts. Yet we ſhould not ſo eaſily have gained the State of <hi>Milan</hi> as is imagined; A number of good pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces would have ſtopped our progreſſe, and given Leiſure to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to ſend thither great releefs from <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Germany;</hi> That if they have quitted the low Countries for a part of <hi>Montferrat,</hi> and expoſed thoſe faire Provinces to th' <hi>Hollanders,</hi> for a little Conveniency in regard of <hi>Milan;</hi> If th' Emperour made a ſhamefull peace with the King of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke</hi> t' intend that Affaire; If he left his victories imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect for that Cauſe, and plenty of forces to th' enemies of th' <hi>Emperour</hi> to renew the Quarrell, and to give him Trouble; what would they not have done, if the State of <hi>Milan</hi> had been aſſaulted: was it not probable that they would have ſet up their reſt to have ſaved it? That they would have ſtirred up all th' ill humours of <hi>France</hi> to divert us? That our fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers of <hi>Champagna,</hi> and <hi>Burgonia</hi> had not been ſafe in that warr, and inſtead of aſſaulting of them, they had, it may be, put us to the termes of defence? Inſomuch that we had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed ourſelves to a preſent and certaine Expence for an uncertaine profit, and at a Diſtance; and for an affaire
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:99746:81"/>wherein th' Apparance of dammage which we ſhould have run, was greater then th'hopes of gaine we could have made. And when all things ſhould have proſpered, that Wind and Tide had been for us, and that th'event of the warr had not deceived our deſires nor fruſtrated our hopes; The fruits of the victory, and what might have been raiſed by our Labours had been no more at moſt then t' have weaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in impoſing an eternall neceſſity of Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell with them, and to Conſume <hi>France</hi> in maintaining the Conqueſts which ſhould not have been ours, and t' aſſure to th' <hi>Italians</hi> the good which we ſhould have don them.</p>
                  <p>From all this I conclude, that the prudence of <hi>Sr. the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall</hi> never appeared more eminently then in the Counſell he gave to quit th' hopes of the Conqueſt of <hi>Milan,</hi> for the Certaine reducement of <hi>Landuedoc,</hi> and that it appertained onely to ſuch Eyes as his, and to an extraordinary wiſdome not to ſuffer himſelfe to be blinded with th' Apparance of the Good which fortune offered us, and t' have preſerved the <hi>King</hi> from ſo ſpecious an Ambuſcado.</p>

                  <p>IT may be alſo obſerved in that valiant reſolution which the <hi>King</hi> took for the Releefe of <hi>Rhé;</hi> That th' Art of making warr hath not a poſitive forme, and that it ought to be diverſified according to the State of Occurrences.

                  <p>They are nevertheleſſe ſome conſiderations to be raiſed in this matter, and certaine Rules to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
                  <p>A Prince that hath but one Army which is the ſinew of his power, and all the force of his State, that hath not Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to raiſe another when the firſt is defeated; ought never t'hazard it: nor give the Command to a Commander of an hot humour, or that hath the Spirit agitated with an exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive deſire of glory. The <hi>Venetians</hi> complain to this day of <hi>Aſuiane</hi> and of his Courage;<note place="margin">At the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell of <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragdale</hi> &amp; that of <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenna.</hi>
                     </note> His conduct was fatall for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo bold: It made them loſe at one blow all their firme Land, and put them another time upon the Borders of their Ruine. And nevertheleſſe all <hi>Historians</hi> agreed, that that perſon had done wonders under a Prince that could have hazarded much. That his vertue was worthy of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of a Conquerour; and that in the journey to <hi>Marig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan</hi> his arrivall with five hundred Horſes put in diſorder all the <hi>Suiſſes,</hi> and made fall in our ſide the Balance where the victory was hung. In the weakneſſe wherein th'<hi>Hollanders</hi> found themſelves, and in the ſmall means which they had to renew their Armyes, The dead <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Orange</hi> hath ever been very backward to give Battell. Even that of <hi>Newport</hi> which he gained was not without ſome ſtaine, and ſome ſhadow of Imprudency, and he hath been condemned in ſuffering himſelfe to be forced to fight; and reduced to a Neceſſity, wherein there vvas to be feared more ill in loſing then hope of good in obtaining the victory. But however a very few perſons have been long in that profeſſion but have committed ſome fault, or fell into ſome Misfortune. Another occaſion wherein this ſlow Conduct is very profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table; and where a victory is to be obtained without fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing if it be poſſible, and to be expected without forcing it to come, is, when we have to do with heady and hot E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies. But in that caſe alſo its neceſſary that they who
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:99746:82"/>are to be commanded be capable of a great Patience, that there be wherewithall to make them long ſubſiſt, and that the faylor of neceſſary proviſions oblige them not to diſband. It was th' Advantage the Duke <hi>Alva</hi> had in the Warrs he commanded, and if <hi>Francis the firſt</hi> had brought a little leſſe and precipitation then he did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Pavia,</hi> and ſuffered th' Imperiall Army to conſume which ſuſtained it ſelfe only upon th'Hopes of a Battell; He had not filled the vegeance of one of his ſubjects, nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated in the ſpirit if th' <hi>Emperour,</hi> the deſigne of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall <hi>Monarchy.</hi> With tumultuary Armies which are not to ſtay long in <hi>COMPAIGNA;</hi> which do only paſſe and poure in and ſteal out quickly; Care muſt be had not to come to blowes: Paſſage muſt be given to them; They muſt be uſed like Torrents, which are permitted to run with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſiſtance, and to whom no oppoſition is made when they ſwell and overflow. Such have been heretofore th' Armies of the <hi>Suiſſes,</hi> when that Nation diſdained all others; and boaſted never to have gone out of their Country but to ſuppreſſe th' exceſſe of Princes, and to defend the weake from the violence of the powerfull, and from the deſignes of th'Ambitious.</p>
                  <p>Other Nations have had in this matter ill opinion of ours, and believed that we were not capable of patience or order. But if the <hi>Marſhall</hi> of <hi>Monlue</hi> be to be believed, and what is ſeen every day in <hi>Holland,</hi> and what of late hath been in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Italy;</hi> Our Souldiers are capable of all things, when they are under good Commanders; and that there's no Nation that takes ſooner then ours, the vices or virtues of their Commanders. However, a great Captain ought e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be Maſter of his Art, and above all the formes of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Warre, without being ſubject to any; He ought to change them according to th' occaſion, and know diverſe means, and many wayes t'attain his end, and gaine the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. By ſuch expedients <hi>Caeſar,</hi> rendred himſelf admirable to all people, and Ages. He diverſified his conduct better then any man in the World. He gave not the ſame forme to all his deſignes, nor the ſame countenance; Induſtry or Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, Patience or force ſerved him equally. One while he aſſaulted his Enemies with Retrenchments and Forts; He Laboured chiefly to take th' <hi>Advantage</hi> of places, and to ceize upon the moſt commodious <hi>Poſtes.</hi> He cut off the Springs of Victuals, and of all other neceſſaries, and forced them at laſt to the neceſſity of rendring, having taken from them the Means of retyring, and th'hope of fighting; He gained his end in that manner of <hi>Petreius</hi> and <hi>Aphranius</hi> whom he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:99746:83"/>in the midſt of a <hi>Compagna,</hi> and from whom he ſhut up ſo dexterouſly all paſſages, and all Avennues that being but halfe a Mile from a River, they dyed with thirſt, and were overcome for want of that whoſe abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance is almoſt in all places; ſometimes he overcame his Enemies by ſtorming of them; He made them fall without Myning; His victories were infamous for fleſh and bloud, and the moſt mercifull of all men ſeemed to be come into the World to decline it, and to have been born for the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine of mankind. The dead King had reduced almoſt to the like extremity the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> at <hi>Juetot,</hi> and all believed infallibly, that he muſt dye of hunger and thirſt, or render at diſcretion, or be defeated in giving Battell. But the deſigne of the King had not th' event anſwerable to <hi>Caeſars,</hi> no more then the vigilancy of his Captains was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to that of th'other; The <hi>Prince of Parma</hi> deceived them and exchanged ſubtilties. He fortified the place he meant to quit, for to make them believe that he would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend himſelf in it; and his Army had paſſed the River and made its retrait, before the firſt News came to our Army; Fatal and un-head of Negligence for an Army that touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ours, and was inveſted, and which was ſuſpected of deſigne, in ſome of the Commanders that governed it.</p>
                  <p>Amongſt the <hi>Modern,</hi> I ſee no Generall that hath ſurpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Ferrant Gonſalve,</hi> nor any perſon more univerſall in th' Art of making Warre; I have not ſeen any perſon that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his forces to better purpoſe, or made better uſe of Patience. With thoſe two Qualities he alwayes overcame us, and hath taken a Kingdome from us. He hath done us as much hurt in making us ſuffer, as in acting againſt us, and hath conſumed us when he was not ſtrong enough to defeat us. Nothing almoſt hath been read like to the Reſolution He expreſt at <hi>Cinture;</hi> where we had reduced him to the laſt paine of Miſery. He was inveſted with our Troops; The Plague and Hunger was in his Army; He was drowned with continuall Raines, ſunke in the durt; expoſed to all th'injuries of a Rude Winter. In brief, he had againſt him th'elements of Men. And nevertheleſſe, at length we were more a weary t'incommodate him, then he was to ſuffer, and deſtroyed us by the courſe we made Choice of to ruine him. But when open force was to be employed, and true Valour ſet a worke; who ever performed it with more Courage or judgement then he? Hath ever a more generous voyce been heard from the mouth of a Captain then the anſwer he made at <hi>Cirignolle,</hi> to him who adviſed him to draw back;
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:99746:83"/>and t' abandon a <hi>Poſte</hi> he could not maintain but with great danger; <hi>He had rather, ſaid he, find Death and his Grave an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Paces beyond it, then to lengthen his Life many years in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traiting ten Paces and turning his back to his Enemies.</hi> And, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Battail of <hi>Garillan,</hi> He anſwered him that would have diverted him from fighting, and giving of Battail, who preſented unto him, that he was weake in reſpect of us, and the Match ill made betwixt his Army and ours, <hi>That he knew of what importance that Daye's Labour was to his Maſter's Affairs, and that he was reſolved to periſh that day, or overcome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis true then, that there are Occurrences, wherein ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what is to be ſubmitted to Fortune: Where the leſſe is to be hazarded to ſave the greater: And where when the Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is of the whole Affair, not onely a part of the Forces is to be hazarded, but alſo the Generalls of th' Army; and thoſe precious heads which command ſo many other heads ought to take reſolution rather to dye, than ſee the Victory in th' Enemies hands, and t' outlive it at their Loſſe. So did <hi>Caeſar</hi> in <hi>Spain</hi> at the Battell where the Children of <hi>Pompey</hi> were ſlaine, and the reſt of that miſerable Common-wealth finiſhed their deſt uction; ſo did <hi>Monſieur of Andelot,</hi> when he defended <hi>Orleans</hi> againſt th' Army of the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Guiſe:</hi> So did the <hi>Prince of Parma</hi> at the ſiege of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> after that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> were ſeized of one part of the Ditch, &amp; that th'Engine which they made to play, had made them flye which defended it; <hi>Th'one and th'other</hi> run with Swords in their hands to the Danger; both were then tranſported Declaring that he would dye, if it were impoſſible for him t'overcome, and made appeare by his action ſomewhat that ſavoured of deſpaire, or rather of that exceſſe which Philoſophy attributes to the <hi>Heroes,</hi> and diſtills into the ſouls of extraordinary perſons. Th'example of that pathetique virtue, and of that generous emotion was not barren. The Souldiers that ſaw it, felt the ſame heat, and by that means ſome of them forced th'Enemies from the Town where they were far entred, and others Recovered the Ditch where th' <hi>Hollanders</hi> began to fortifie after they were lodged in it; Lets conclude then with th'Examples of the greateſt perſons of Antiquity, and with the firſt of the Moderne, That the paſſage of our Army into th' Iland of <hi>Rhé</hi> was not projected by chance, and without th' Advice of Reaſon; That it hath not been th'Effect of a light, troubled by ill ſucceſſe, and of a Diſcourſe confuſed by ill fortune; but of a Reſolution illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated by that high prudence, which diverſifieth its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct according to the diverſity of accidents which happen; which ſhift; ſayles according t' th' nature of the Winds
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:99746:84"/>which Reign: Which knows t' apply Remedies to the ſtate of the Maladies; which dares quit th' High-wayes, when'tis expedient to take the By-paths, and which guides not alwayes common virtues, but ſometimes inſpires, and gives birth t'Heroique perſons.</p>

                  <head type="sub">Of the Alliances of bloud which are practiſed amongſt Princes; and whether the King was well adviſed when he made that Ally<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with <hi>England.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>I Treat at large th'Allyances of State in the ſecond part of this work, and particularly of that we have with the <hi>Turke,</hi> and with the Republique of <hi>Holland.</hi> There I do cleer ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Doubts which reſpect the Soul, and take away the ſtones of offence whereat they ſtrike, who have not known the foundation, and ſtumble for want of Light. I give never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs nothing to conveniency that is contrary to juſtice, and flatter not the conduct of them who ſubmit all other Reaſons to that of State. I take nothing there, from God to give it to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> I hold the juſt Balance, and ſtay at the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per which God hath adviſed, in the prudence of Serpents and the ſimplicity of Doves. Here I have thought it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient, to ſpeak of th' Allyances, which are practiſed in the families of Princes, to justiſfie that which hath been made with <hi>England.</hi> All the ſpirits that were formalized at it, are not yet ſatisfied. The Wounds which are ſhut up leave all wayes ſome marks; Some maligne impreſſion remains a long time after a poyſon is driven away; and ordinarily the opinions that are left, part not ſo neatly, but ſome impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on remains. On th'other ſide, they that have obſerved the ſequells of th' Alliance whereof we ſpeak; who have ſeen the Depraedations upon our Seas, and th'Invaſions of our Ilands, and th'other enterprizes th'<hi>Engliſh</hi> have made upon us; Who have underſtood, that their Miniſters of State ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadged that buſineſs with poyſoned hands; that they did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine us when they ſeemed to help us; That they ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Cloath whereof they were after call'd Merchants, and laid the foundation of the War which they made againſt us. Theſe I ſay, have believed that there was ſomewhat wanting in the prudence of our Miniſters of State, and that th' houſe was ill built that fell ſo ſoon to Ruine. Wherefore having diſcourſed of that Warr; I thought this the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place to ſpeak of the Alliance which did precede it.</p>
                  <p>I ſay then, that th' Alliances of bloud which are entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:99746:84"/>amongſt Princes ſerve very little to divert their deſignes, or to change their Inclinations. The diſpoſitions they find in their ſpirits are there left; They put up nothing, but at moſt palliate them, and ſuſpend for ſome time th' Action of the Cauſes which they cannot take away; And though it falls out otherwiſe in the Condition of particular perſons, no Conſequence is to be drawne for that of Princes. The Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of <hi>Soveraignes</hi> which Princes ſuſtaine, hath priviledged Duties, and begets paſſions to which all others are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterne. The King in this is above Man. The Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Parentage is inferiour to that of the State, and th'Obligations of blood which are bounded in a few perſons ought to give place to th' obligations of the Charge, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in an infinite of Perſons are Intereſſed. To that truly, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces need not to be Exhorted; They are but too much car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to it naturally; They ordinarily offend leſſe againſt their Dignity by default, then by exceſſe. The love they have for it, degenerates rather into Jealouſie, then into Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And if you would have them forſake their intereſts, and the good of their affaires; It muſt be under the ſhew of ſomething that reſembles it: And 'tis not the will, that a Man ought to propoſe to himſelfe to be gained, but th' un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, which is by Endeavour to be ſeduced; But 'tis true, that of too Extreams which bound the duty of Princes, they carry themſelves oftneſt to th' Exceſſe, and that the paſſion for Commanding preſerves not onely what belongs to them, but makes uſurpations upon all the Rights of Reaſon; upon all the priviledges of Humane Society, and upon all the Reſpects, which are brought by Relations. Th' Examples are ſo ordinary that a Man muſt have ſeen or heard nothing to call it in Queſtion. I will not ſpeak of what hath paſſed in the time of the <hi>Pagans,</hi> nor of that Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious <hi>Roman</hi> who cauſed her Chariot, to be drove over the Body of her <hi>Father,</hi> to whoſe kingdome her Husband ought to ſucceed. I paſſe by that which they might have done who thought, that the glory of Command was the ultimate End of Man, and Ambition ſomewhat a nobler and a better thing then juſtice. But even amongſt the very <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and in th' houſes which Piety hath made famous, that Paſſion hath been ſeen t' overflow to the prejudice of blood, and violate th' holieſt lawes of Nature, and which the very barbarous people Reverence. I will recite here a Memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Example. 'Tis a thing ſufficiently known in the world what th' houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> was to th' Alliance of blood; and if devotion, as tis ſaid, hath been the foundation of Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, 'tis well known, that Alliance hath built it up, and
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:99746:85"/>carried it from a Moderate beginning to that high Power wherein 'tis ſeen, and to that vaſt domination for which th' Heaven hath <hi>no Horizon,</hi> nor th'earth Limits. <hi>Maximilian the firſt</hi> hath gained by that means the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> and thoſe faire Provinces which by their fertility, and by the wealth wherewith they abound, have deſerved to be called th' <hi>Indies</hi> of <hi>Europe. Philip the firſt</hi> and his poſterity have obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it all <hi>Spaine,</hi> and thoſe Countryes of the new world, where the ſun in retiring from us goes to beget Gold, and thoſe other unprofitable things whereof men are Idolaters. <hi>Philip the ſecond</hi> came to the Crown of <hi>Portugall</hi> by that meanes; and to all thoſe States which that Nation poſſeſſed in <hi>Aſia,</hi> in <hi>Afrique,</hi> and th' <hi>Eaſt Indies.</hi> That very Prince thought t' incorporate <hi>England to Spaine</hi> by the marriage of <hi>Mary</hi> his firſt wife, that was Queen thereof. But the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God in that ſupplanted the prudence of men, and permitted that Princeſſe to dye without Children, either to ſuppreſs the growth of a Power which would have been fatal to the Liberty of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Nations, or for the puniſhment of the Iniquities of th' <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and that baſe Compliance, wherewith they had received the Schiſm which <hi>Henry th' Eighth</hi> introduced amongſt them, and applauded the paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of that Prince who choſe rather to quit the Church, then to ſeparate from a Concubine. The ſame <hi>Philip</hi> alſo aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired to the Crown of <hi>France</hi> for his Children, by reaſon of the Marriage of his third wife daughter of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond; and the moſt important Article wherewith th' Inſtructions of the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Feria</hi> were Charged when he came to <hi>Paris</hi> during the league, was, to cauſe the <hi>Salique</hi> laws to be Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſht, and to root out from the ſpirit of the <hi>French</hi> their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of having no <hi>Soveraignes</hi> that ſpin, and of not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to th' yoak of Women. Inſomuch, that it hath been allwayes the deſigne of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and a premeditated prudence of the <hi>Princes</hi> of th' houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> to look about them, and to caſt their nets upon the parties that could joyne ſome new eſtate to theirs, and under a Title ſo inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and juſt t'extend their domination. With what heat did they labour to cauſe the eldeſt Daughter of <hi>Lewis the twelfth to</hi> be given to <hi>Charles the fifth</hi> who brought for her Dowry the <hi>Dutcheſſe</hi> of <hi>Britanny</hi> and of <hi>Orleans,</hi> and our pretentions for <hi>Italy?</hi> How many propoſitions were made upon that foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and how many treaties concluded, which the Time hath made abortive, and which Fortune laughed at; Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe as they have been ever Induſtrious to draw to them as much as they could, th'eſtates of their Neighbours, They have been alſo carefull, not to permit any of theirs
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:99746:85"/>to be alienated, nor to ſuffer any diviſion without knowing the Meanes of Conſolidating it; and to deſtroy the divided Members, and the looſe pieces.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Th' Emperour Charles</hi> never promiſed the <hi>Low Countryes,</hi> or the <hi>Duthy</hi> of <hi>Milan</hi> upon the Marriage of his daughter, or of his Neece with the ſon of <hi>France,</hi> but with Intention to break his promiſe, or at leaſt with hopes, that <hi>Fortune</hi> which had done ſuch ſtrange things, in his favour; that had ſo often gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Lye to Apparences, and diſturbed th' order of things for the Love of him, and which had ſometimes ſent him proſperities which he deſired not, would exempt him from that Obligation under ſome plauſible pretence, as it did. And when <hi>Philip the ſecond</hi> tranſmitted the Low <hi>Countryes</hi> to th' <hi>Arch Dutcheſſe</hi> for her Dowry; There's apparence that he was aſſured, that time would make up that Breach, and that he made not ſo great a wound in the reſt of his Eſtates with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out preparing the Remedies to heale it. But to returne to my deſigne, and make it appeare, That th' Alliances of blood, work ſoftly upon the ſpirits of <hi>Princes,</hi> and are but weake bonds t' hold their Amities; I will repreſent th' ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall, and th' effects of that which hath been the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to th'houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and it may be the moſt dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mageable to the Chriſtian Common-wealth. <hi>Philip the ſon of th' Emperour Maximilian, married Joane youngeſt Daughter of Ferdinand and Iſabella, Kings of all the dominions of Spaine.</hi> Th' Eldeſt was married into <hi>Portugall</hi> according to their Cuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome. The Catholique <hi>King</hi> had alſo a ſon called <hi>John</hi> who dyed young, and whom <hi>Spaine</hi> ſaw almoſt as ſoon put out as ſhine, and had almoſt at one time the Contentment to ſee him come, and the Griefe to loſe him; Preſently after the death of that <hi>Prince,</hi> th'Arch <hi>Duke Philip,</hi> and Arch <hi>Dutcheſſe his wife</hi> who lived onely by the love ſhe bare to her husband, and was Idolatreſſe of all his motions and paſſions, cauſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be Called Princes of all the Dominions of <hi>Spain,</hi> to the prejudice of the Queen of <hi>Portugall,</hi> to whom the Crownes did belong in priority of birth to her ſiſter. That attempt ill digeſted &amp; out ſeaſon, and that precipitated Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, diſpleaſed Infinitely <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Iſabella,</hi> who judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Tree by the fruits, and gave their ſon in Law and daughter t'underſtood, that they were to leave that bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed Title, and to put off that imaginary Quality, and which did not belong to them. Behold a very pleaſant Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>Philips</hi> Ambition, ſince it made Invaſions upon its owne Relations, and the firſt ſhew of that furious Appetite to reigne which hath vexed his Poſterity; After that he guided his Intereſts apart from them of his Father in Law;
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:99746:86"/>He held him alwayes at diſtance, he looked upon him only as a Prince which ſtood in his light, and there was no other Communication amongſt them but a continual Commerce of Complaints and diſorders; In a Treaty which <hi>Maximi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> and he, made at <hi>Blois</hi> with <hi>Lewis the twelfth,</hi> being permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted t' either parties, to Comprehend therein whom they would, He made no more mention of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> then as if he had not related to him, or that He had been indifferent to him. He did alſo the ſame thing in another Treaty which his <hi>Father</hi> made at <hi>Hugano</hi> with the <hi>Cardinal</hi> of <hi>Ambois;</hi> ſo <hi>Ferdinand</hi> had his Revenge in diſavowing the Treaty his ſon in Law made at <hi>Blois</hi> with <hi>Lewis the twelfth</hi> for the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Naples,</hi> and in Contracting a ſecond Marriage, and marying of <hi>Germania</hi> ſiſter of <hi>Gaſton</hi> of <hi>Foix,</hi> and Neece of <hi>Lewis,</hi> with Conditions that were Advantageous to us, if they had been obſerved. That which I have ſaid neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe was nothing in reſpect of what <hi>Philip</hi> did, ſince the death of <hi>Iſabella,</hi> and after taht the ſucceſſion of <hi>Caſtille</hi> was open unto him. The things paſt were but ſweetneſſes for <hi>Ferdinand</hi> in Compariſon of th' uſage he received after that death. The firſt ſtroakes did ſcarce raiſe the ſkin, but the laſt entered deep and made Large and dangerous wounds. <hi>Philip</hi> will go into <hi>Spaine</hi> not onely to take poſſeſſion of what was his, but to take from his Father in <hi>Law</hi> what belonged to him by the Teſtament of <hi>Iſabella, Ferdinand</hi> employed all his Prudence, and all his ſubtilties to divert him. They Conteſt long upon that Article. Their wills were diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trically oppoſed; what th'one would not have th' other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, and it had been leſſe difficult t' accord Contraryes, and to joyne extreams, then t' adjuſt their pretentions. Force being wanting to <hi>Ferdinand</hi> t' overcome th' heat of <hi>Philip,</hi> He uſed diverſion; He cauſed <hi>Lewis the twelfth</hi> t' in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe who threatens him with his Armyes, in caſe he went for <hi>Spaine,</hi> and raiſed the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Gueldiers</hi> againſt him who cut him out buſineſs in <hi>Flaunders,</hi> and gave him enough t' entertaine him in that Countrey.</p>
                  <p>In th' End, th'obſtinacy of <hi>Philip</hi> being ſtronger then th' Artifices of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and the difficulties which ſtopped him being taken away or ſweetned, they agreed upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of his journey. Thereupon <hi>Philip</hi> put himſelfe on the way, but with a reſolution to break the Treaty he had made, and not performeth' Oath he had given to his Father in Law, which he ought to have kept to an Enemy. Being in <hi>Spaine</hi> he flatters the great Perſons; He unties them from <hi>Ferdinand;</hi> He drawes them to his party, who had but too great Inclinations for it, and were but too earneſtly carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:99746:86"/>t' adore the riſing Power, and a Light which began to ſhew it ſelfe; Inſomuch, that <hi>Ferdinand</hi> found himſelfe alone: All his friends were unfaithfull to him; all his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures abandoned him except th' <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Toledo Xime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> and the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Al<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>After that, <hi>Ferdinand</hi> preſſeth an Interview with his ſon in Law; The Counſellours of <hi>Philip</hi> oppoſe it with all their powers, and raiſe troubleſome difficulties to divert it; They had ſeized upon the ſpirits of their Maſter, and taken his will from him having prepoſſeſſed his underſtanding. They were afraid, that <hi>Ferdinand</hi> would take off the Charme, and that the Reverence of a Father, and dexterity of a Great <hi>Polititian</hi> would deface that uſurped Empire, and tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Domination: wherefore they omit nothing that might diſtate <hi>Ferdinand</hi> from the meeting he ſolicited, and which he preſſed for the Reſiſtance; They propoſe exorbitant Conditions, which he accepts of; They add ſhamefull Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances which he refuſed not; They uſe him unworthily and he bears it; and a Great <hi>King</hi> had the diſpleaſure to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Law from petty Companions, who abuſed th' In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of an eaſy Maſter.</p>
                  <p>At laſt th' Interview being reſolved, <hi>Ferdinand</hi> renders himſelfe at the place appointed for that purpoſe, but with a ſmall traine, and accompanied onely with two hundred Men unarmed, and mounted upon Mules. On the Contrary, <hi>Philip</hi> advanceth thither, in th' Equipage of a Man of warr, with the Body of an army of <hi>Dutch,</hi> which Marched before him, and flanked with almoſt all the Great Perſons of <hi>Spaine</hi> in armes, and in the poſture of perſons who went rather to Warr, then to a Treaty of friendſhip, and to a fight rather then to a Reconciliation. The two Princes met together in a Chappell, which had been Choſen for that Interview; <hi>Don John Manuell, principall Counſellour of Philip,</hi> and abſolute diſpoſer of his reſolutions would aſſiſt at their diſcourſe, and but for th' <hi>Arch Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Toledo,</hi> who hindred him, He had been preſent at a Conference, which the Reſpect of proximity and the Dignity of thoſe Two <hi>Princes,</hi> would have to be ſecret.</p>
                  <p>After an hower and halfes diſcourſe they part, and the Conference paſſed without any mention made by <hi>Philip</hi> to the <hi>Father</hi> of his daughter, nor of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> to his ſon in Law of his wife. He diſſembled for that time his deſire, though he had an extreame paſſion to ſee her, and to Comfort his
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:99746:87"/>old age by the ſight of an Object which was ſo deere to him, and which was the Remainder of his ſubſtance.</p>
                  <p>There was a ſecond Meeting betwixt theſe two <hi>Princes,</hi> wherein ſome demonſtration of friendſhip appeared, or leſſe coldneſs then at the firſt Interview; But the Concluſion of all the Conferences was the firſt deſigne of <hi>Philip,</hi> that <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand</hi> ſhould renouce the Government of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the diſpoſition of <hi>Iſabella,</hi> and againſt the expreſſe Clauſes of her Teſtament, <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> who had learnt t'obey the time and ſubmit to Neceſſity; who knew how to ſtrike ſaile when the Tempeſt was too ſtrong; and to put in when it was not ſafe to ſaile; Bends under his ill <hi>Fortune,</hi> and reſolves t' abandon <hi>Caſtille</hi> till a better ſeaſon called it back, and to baniſh himſelfe voluntarily from a kingdome which he had ſo long Commanded; <hi>Philip</hi> ſtops not there, He endeavours all he can to diſcredit the paſt Government, He annulls the greateſt part of th' Orders his <hi>Father</hi> in <hi>Law</hi> had made; He depoſeth the principall officers, and the principall Governours, which had been placed by his Hand. He would not, if poſſible, that one entire mark ſhould remain, nor one viſible Impreſſion of his Adminiſtration. But it had been too little for him to have ill uſed his <hi>Father</hi> in <hi>Law,</hi> and his Ambition, it may be, had been pardonable; if it had at leaſt pardoned his wife, and if he had not uſed her ill who had brought him ſo faire States, and ſuch certaine Hopes. She was truly the Queen of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and who infuſed into her Huſband, th' Authority of Government, and the Right of Commanding that Country. And nevertheleſſe He would not ſuffer her in that ſociety; He would not permit, that ſhe who was Companion of his Bed, ſhould be the Companion of the Scepter which he had received from her hands; and ſeeks ſhamefull pretences and odious Cauſes t' exclude her. A warmer love was never ſeen, than what that <hi>Princeſſe</hi> had for her Husband; It ſeemed, that ſhe lived onely by the ſight of him, and dyed when ſhe was ſevered from him. That Exceſſe of paſſion and Imbecillity of ſoul changed in ſome ſort her ſenſes; and the jealouſie which mingled with the troubles of his Abſence, weakened a little her Braine and changed th' Organs; and nevertheleſſe though that defect proceeded from ſo honeſt a Cauſe, or ſo ſupportable; Though Compaſſion ought to have obliged <hi>Philip</hi> to cover it, if Love were wanting to do it; and though Conveniency and his honour obliged him alſo to that duty, when he had neither Compaſſion nor love; He will nevertheleſſe that that accident be the foundation of his deſigne, to ſeize upon all th' authority ad to Reigne alone. He will have his wife to
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:99746:87"/>be entirely troubled of her ſenſes, though ſhe was onely a little weake; He will, that ſhe hath loſt all he Reaſon, though ſhe had onely diminiſhed it; That there was no Light at all, when there was onely a Miſt; and that ſhe was in a totall inability to governe, though there remained in her enough of good ſenſe t' act; For that effect, and the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter t' hide his Game, he keeps her ſhut up, and permits not any perſon to ſee her of them that durſt ſpeake to her of the State of her diſeaſe. A ſtrangeproceeding, to take away her Liberty, after he had taken away her Honour! and not to leave th' ſe of the firſt good of naturall life after had rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned th' Ornament of the Civil; The <hi>Father</hi> durſt not open his mouth to him of it, in the firſt Conference they had together, and choſe rather to ſuppreſſe his Inclination, then to ſharpen more that ſpirit, which was but too ſharp; and to touch him in a place where he was ſo ſenſible, as I have above obſerved. In the ſecond Meeting, <hi>Philip</hi> obtained of him a ſecret Declaration by the which he conſented that he alone ſhould have th' adminiſtration of State, by reaſon of th' Inability of his daughter, though after he made a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique proteſtation, That his <hi>ſon in Law</hi> had forced from him that Declaration, and that he gave way onely to the Malice of the time, and to the violence of the ſtronger, according to the Maxime of wiſe Men. <hi>Philip</hi> ſtaid not there, after that <hi>Ferdinand</hi> was retired into <hi>Arragon,</hi> He would oblige the <hi>Grandies</hi> of <hi>Spaine</hi> to ſubſcribe an Act, which he had cauſed to be drawne, of the weakeneſs of the ſenſes wherein the <hi>Queene</hi> was fallen. But therein he found Reſiſtance. Th' <hi>Admirall</hi> of <hi>Caſtille</hi> oppoſeth it generouſly, after he had viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that <hi>Princeſſe,</hi> and diſcovered that the diſpoſition of her Underſtanding was not entirely ſpoiled; Repreſented unto him, th' Inconveniencies that would ariſe from that Enterprize; The noiſe it would make in the world, and th' ill hmours it would raiſe in <hi>Spaine,</hi> where the people love their Maſters naturally, becauſe of the Roialty they exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, and reverence that Character in every perſon in whom 'tis Imprinted.</p>
                  <p>At laſt, to give the world the finall Example of ingratitude, and an Eminent evidence of the power of Jealouſie, to reigne without a companion when it hath taken poſſeſſion of the ſoul; He would cauſe his wife to be declared troubled in her ſenſes in full aſſembly of the States, and by Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence unable to governe, which he could not obtaine. There was his acknowledgment of th' incomparable fidelity of that <hi>Princeſſe,</hi> and the paiment of the moſt violent and durable love, that ever wife bare to a Husband. Therein
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:99746:88"/>was his recompence of that eternall paſſion which poſſeſſe her during the Life of <hi>Phillip</hi> to the change of his ſpirit; which could not be abated by his Death, and time that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercomes what is moſt firme in the World, and moſt opinio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, could never diminiſh. For 'tis true, that after the Death of <hi>Phillip</hi> which was precipitated, &amp; which cropt him in the Flower of his <hi>Age,</hi> &amp; with ſome ſuſpition of poyſon, ſhe never forſook the body, ſhe cauſed his Coffine very day to be opened; ſhe took it with her when ſhe travelled, and accompliſhed what had been propheſied by an Old Woman of <hi>Spain,</hi> who had ſaid, ſeeing th'entry of <hi>Phillip</hi> into that Kingdom, and that proud Magnificence wherewith he took poſſeſſion, <hi>That he would walke there longer after his death, then during his life.</hi> At laſt, after his body was laid in a Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell of <hi>Granada</hi> in the <hi>Sepulchre</hi> of the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Caſtille,</hi> ſhe made her conſtant ſtay in that City, and powred out into Tears and Groans the reſt of her Life, upon the Aſhes of him, whom ſhe had loved with ſo great Heat, and upon the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines of a body which ſhe had Idolized.</p>
                  <p>To what end ſerves then th'Alliances of bloud, which are made amongſt Princes? and ſince they have been inſtituted t'unite in friendſhip diverſe families, and t'extend them the more, and enlarge that virtue which is one of the Principles of the civill Life, and one of the bonds of humain ſociety; what uſe are they of in the conditions of <hi>Soveraigns?</hi> They may ſerve much, and are not unprofitable; provided that they come not in competition with th'Intereſts of State, and with that invincible jealouſie which Princes have for the good of their Affairs. The treaties where they intervene, are made with more reputation and dignity, They are pretious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences to lay down Armes, which two Princes are a weary to bear; they are honeſt doores to let out warrs, from which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe they cannot retire with honour, and which they cannot Continue without dammage. And there's no reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſo juſt which they may not ſafely ſubmit to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the Parentage into which they enter, and of that ſacred bond which is inſtituted to conjoyne what is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, and t' unite the wills which are diſunited. <hi>Francis the firſt</hi> recovered his liberty with more honour by Marrying the ſiſter of <hi>Charles th' Emperour,</hi> and he made appeare to the World th' Eſteeme he gave to his Priſoner, in ſeeking his alliance. The peace of <hi>Soiſſons</hi> which followed a warr where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſame Princes did run two great though different <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes;</hi> Th' one to loſe a part of his States, and th' other of his Reputation in retiring; Had for foundation the Marriage that ſtaid it; and which was not accompliſhed betwixt
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:99746:88"/>
                     <hi>Charles third ſon of France,</hi> and one of the Daughters of th' Emperour, or one of his Neeces. The peace of the Caſtle of <hi>Cambrey</hi> which was ſo pernicious to <hi>France;</hi> which took from us in one day, what we gained in Forty yeares, which being th' End of our forraigne warrs, was, it may, he the Beginning of Civill warrs; Comprehended the Marriage of <hi>Elizabeth, Daughter of Henry th' ſecond, with Philip the ſecond King of Spaine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The daughters which enter into <hi>Soveraigne</hi> Houſes may alſo do much for th' Intereſts of them from whence they come, when they ſeize upon the ſpirits of their Husbands, and gaine th' Aſcendent upon their Wills which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times happens. That ſubtile <hi>Portugeſe</hi> which Married <hi>Charles the third Duke</hi> of <hi>Savoy,</hi> did what ſhe would with him; in the differences of <hi>Francis the ſecond, and Charles the fifth.</hi> And in that famous diſſention whereof <hi>Piedmont</hi> was ſo long the <hi>Theater,</hi> ſhe turned Her nephew of th' <hi>Emperours</hi> ſide, though the good of his affaires obliged him, to be of our ſide, and made him take the moſt diſadvantagious part in a warr, wherein he had even done himſelfe wrong if he had ſtood a Neutrall. That <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> underſtood it better, and her Conduct was more judicious though it may be not juſt enough. Her father and Husband were <hi>Entred</hi> into a Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, and laboured with great Obſtinacy the Ruine of one Another.</p>
                  <p>In that hard Acceſſe, and cruell Conjuncture, wherein ſhe could not gaine without loſſe; ſhe propoſed to herſelfe to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low alwayes the fortune of the weakeſt, to make the Counterpoiſe to the ſtrongeſt, and to diſpoſe them to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, when both deſpaired of the victory, which ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded unto her. Alliances are alſo good to preſerve union, and nouriſh th' Intelligence of Houſes which otherwiſe are obliged to be of good underſtanding, and which a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon intereſt doth conjoyne and bind. Inſomuch that if they make not the knot, they tye it faſter, If they forme not the friendſhip, they heat it; if they do not introduce the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, they confirme it; Tis for that reaſon they are ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent amongſt the Princes of th' Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and were heretofore betwixt them of <hi>France and Navarre,</hi> and betwixt them of <hi>Caſtille</hi> and <hi>Portugall,</hi> before th' union of thoſe Crowns. But what muſt be underſtood of moſt certain from Alliances, and to which Princes who make them, and their Counſellors, ought chiefly to have an eye; is, to draw ſome preſent utility, or ſome future good, whilſt the Wills of them who are conjoyned in Alliance, are in heat, and th' e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion which that Bond brings doth laſt. <hi>Francis the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:99746:89"/>firſt</hi> married <hi>Elnor, Siſter of Charls the ſiſth</hi> to recover his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, as I have ſaid; <hi>Phillip the ſecond</hi> gave his youngeſt Daughter to the laſt <hi>Duke of Savoy</hi> to make him ſeiſe upon the <hi>Marquiſat of Saluce,</hi> and to cauſe the Gates of <hi>Italy</hi> to be ſhut againſt us, and to deliver <hi>Milan,</hi> from the jealouſie which that neighbourhood gave it. <hi>Ferdinand of Caſtille</hi> Marryed <hi>Germania, Neece of Lewis the twelfth,</hi> to break the Leagues which were framed betwixt <hi>Lewis, the Emperour Maximilian, and th' Arch Duke Phillip</hi> to his prejudice, and to diſſipate th'In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligences of thoſe Princes that were not favourable unto him.</p>
                  <p>In conſideration whereof I ſay that the Alliance which the King had made with the King of <hi>England,</hi> ought to be placed amongſt his wiſeſt Elections in the felicities of his Reign. And that they who adviſed him to it could not give a ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Counſel, and that it hath been a great honour to <hi>Sr. the Candinall</hi> to have mingled his Cares with thoſe of his Maſter, and his diſturbances with his Maſter's for th'accompliſhment of that worke. 'Tis not a ſmall advantage to render ones enemies weake; and to make a power retire that is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to us or ſuſpected, is a great advance; But tis the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of wiſedom to draw to ones ſelfe a good that was intended for them that love us not; &amp; to gain that which we make them loſe. If we had not made haſte, <hi>Spain</hi> who ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered that Alliance t'eſcape their hands, and which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times loſeth her Advantages in ſeeking of them too cunningly and too great; Had, it may be, renewed it. And if that had been, is it not probable, that it had invention enough and Artifice for to keep us alwayes in Check by the means of <hi>England;</hi> That it had manadged at pleaſure the Proteſtants of <hi>France</hi> with their hands, and had aſſured all his deſignes in making the Counterpoyſe to ours with that party which was alſo entire; That the loſſes which they lately received had affrighted them more then beaten them, and that the ſight of their wounds yet bloudy, and the deſire of revenge rendred them irreconcilable; tis at leaſt certaine, that it diverted the Ruine, and was oppoſed to its dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage.</p>
                  <p>That if <hi>England</hi> hath turned her Arms upon us; if it hath ſince quarrell'd us; and if the capricious humours of a particular perſon hath been the Torch of a publique diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; It was a ſtroak which was not in the power of humain diſcourſe to foreſee, and the reaſon of State did not permit that a Prince ſhould give ſo pernicious an example to his ſubjects, as openly to favour <hi>Felony</hi> in the ſtates of another <hi>Prince;</hi> yet it may be ſaid in truth, that the peace which enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:99746:89"/>that War, and which was ſo advantagious to us, is in part an effect of th'Alliance whereof we ſpeak, and the worke of that <hi>Princeſſe</hi> which ſhall be hereafter th' Indiſſoluble band of the friendſhip of the two Brothers, and th' Immortall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the Concord of both Nations. Adde to this th' In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of Religion which is very conſiderable in this Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, of the great good it produceth to have accuſtomed th'<hi>Engliſh</hi> to permit th' exerciſe of it in the Queen's family. Tis no ſmall matter that they are made acquainted with our Holy Myſteries, and that they are no longer offended at that which they have had a long time in deteſtation; Tis to be believed, that this holy humanity which now is in ſafety amongſt them, ſhall not be there without a taſt of its Graces; and that th'Example of good ſouls to whom'tis permitted to provide for their ſafety without crime, may touch them, and bring them to the knowledge of that truth their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had forſaken.</p>

Heretofore nothing was more eaſie to a Conquerour then to ſubdue a Province,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:99746:90"/>and the gaine of a battell delivered up a whole Countrey to the victorious: wherein there was ſcarce any ſtrong place. Now that th' Art of making Warre hath changed face and conduct; That 'tis in all Countryes almoſt redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to caſt up Earth and to retrench; That few Battells are fought; that the life of Men are better Husbanded; and that an Army cannot March very farre, but a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſe is in its way; 'Tis no marvell, if there be as much difficulty, and by conſequence as much glory to take a <hi>Fortreſs</hi> of Reputation, as there was heretofore to gain a Province. And not to go farre from paſt Ages, and the memory of our <hi>Fathers.</hi> Have we not ſeen with what facility <hi>Mahomet the ſecond</hi> hath taken two Empires from <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and carried from them Twelve Kingdoms? Will it not be ſaid, that he did runne only in conquering, and that th' exerciſe of a walke had been as long as the time of his Rapid Victories? 'Tis, that, in effects, in thoſe great <hi>Territories</hi> of Countrey, and extent of thoſe vaſt Regions there was not a good place but <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> And yet that place was loſt rather by the Conwardiſe of <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and in the fury of the juſtice of God, than by the valour of the <hi>Turks,</hi> and induſtry of the beſiegers. <hi>Selin</hi> the firſt had only the <hi>Mammeluns</hi> to defeat in the Field to be Maſter of all <hi>Aegypt</hi> and <hi>Syria,</hi> and the progreſſe which the <hi>Grand Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors</hi> made heretofore in <hi>Perſia,</hi> and the facility they found to poſſeſſe that Land, proceeded from that they encountered not one ſtrong Town that ſtopped them and hindred the Inundation of thoſe Monſtrons Armies which they brought thither. On the Contrary, who doubts but that the conqueſt of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> was not more honourable to <hi>Soliman,</hi> then that of th' Empire of <hi>Trob<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

And if he could have added <hi>Maltha</hi> and joyned <hi>Vienna</hi> to his other victories, the paſt Ages had not ſeen fairer Trophies then his, and he might have mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in Front with <hi>Alexander, Caeſar,</hi> and <hi>Tamerlan,</hi> though he had not run over ſo many Nations as they had done, nor invaded ſo great a number of Countries.</p>
                  <p>To give ſome new Light to my ſubject, and ſome extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary colours, I will propoſe alſo that noble difficulty which ſome have written of. To wit, Which of the two Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons is moſt noble, and meritorious, either the gaine of Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, or the Taking of a good place; without ſtaying upon that which hath been ſaid upon this ſubject. It ſeems to me,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:99746:90"/>that the laſt of theſe Actions requires a more profound and more generall abilitie; That it exerciſeth more virtues; and by Conſequence there's more honour in taking a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſe well defended, then to win a Battell though it be well Conteſted. The reaſon is, that in a ſiege Men muſt fight above th' Earth, and in th' Earth. The ſtrength of the place is to be overcome, and the Reſiſtance of men. Freſh ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies are to be encountered, which are Concealed and do expect. Men are expoſed to th' Artifices of fire, and to thoſe horrible Inventions which with death bring the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Hell, and paines that are not naturall; Long la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours are to be endured, Continuall watching, and all th' Injuries of time.</p>
                  <p>Briefly, Induſtry works more there then force, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune acts leſſe there then virtue; That happens not in a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, where Men fight onely above Ground againſt Men; where all things are almoſt equall on both ſides; where Men are not conſumed by Languiſhments, and Travell; and where four howers decides the buſineſs; where Impetuoſity doth act ſometimes more then Conduct, and valour gives not ſo much the victory as extravagancy of fortune, as a command ill underſtood of th' Enemies ſide, as an unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected Accident, and as a <hi>Pannique</hi> Terrour.</p>
                  <p>But to decide this doubt with a more exact and certaine Policy; I ſay, that thoſe Meanes are more noble and Eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable which produce th' End that is propoſed, and brings a Man to the Mark he Aimes at; than they that leave a Man in the Middle of the way, be they never ſo glittering, and what ſhew ſoever they make. And therefore if the gaine of a Battell were the Conqueſt of a <hi>Province</hi> as it heretofore hapned, and the taking of a Towne the reducement of a ſingle place, as it falls out for the moſt part; There's no Queſtion but the ſecond Action is inferiour to the firſt, and of an Inferiour Merit to that of th' other. But when after the gaine of a Battell th' enemie continues ſtrong, where there are other armyes to fight, and a number of good places which ſtop the Conquerour, and put a Bridle to the victory; Who doubts, but the gaine of that Battell is leſſe Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable then the taking of a City, which is th' head of a whole Countrey, or of a whole party; which will bring in all the reſt to th' obedience of the victorious; and after that no Reſiſtance to be made but what ſhall be weake and raſh. Who doubts that <hi>Scipio</hi> did not more in ſubduing <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,</hi> and making the Rivall of <hi>Rome</hi> the Subject of <hi>Rome;</hi> than <hi>Hanibal</hi> did in the three Battells wherein he Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered the <hi>Roman;</hi> ſince <hi>Rome</hi> ſubſiſted for all that, and that
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:99746:91"/>the ſpring of the warr remained unſtopt. And therefore who can alſo doubt, that the reducement of <hi>Rochell,</hi> after the loſſe whereof we have ſeen a party fall, which had ſo long a ſhare in <hi>France,</hi> and divided the <hi>Soveraigne</hi> authority; which had offered ſo many affronts to our <hi>Kings;</hi> which had ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten opened our parts; and our frontiers to th' Enemies of the State, and made the Country of their Birth, a Country of Conqueſt; who can I ſay doubt, that the taking thereof is not to be preferred before four Battails, which have been gained againſt it; becauſe they left life and force to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; ſince that all-bloudy and coverd with wounds, it was formidable unto them that had put it into that Condition; ſince after that, it gave the law to the victorious, and forced a peace of as much advantage, as could have been expected from a victory. That conſideration obliged th' <hi>Holy Father</hi> t' anſwer <hi>Cardinal Borgia</hi> who had repreſented unto him, that he had not made the like demonſtration of joy for the tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Breda,</hi> which he had done for the taking of <hi>Rochell; The Taking of Breda was no more then the taking of a Towne where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of th' Hollanders had their Revenge a little after.</hi> But the Taking of <hi>Rochell,</hi> was beating downe th'head of a <hi>body</hi> and <hi>overthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> the foundations of a Building.</p>

                  <p>AFter the precedent Conſiderations, lets ſee what may be obſerved in that ſiege which ſerves for my principall deſigne, and for th'Inſtructions of the <hi>Publique.</hi> 'Tis not <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi> alone that knew how t' overcome, and knew not how t' uſe the victory. The like faults are encountered in all ages, and the cauſe why ſometimes Men are not happy enough, is becauſe Men are not alwayes wiſe enough. Fortune alone may very well begin the greatneſſe of a Man, but ſhe cannot finiſh it, without virtue. And though it be not in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of expert Pilots to make the winds propitious; It de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends nevertheleſſe upon their Induſtry to make good uſe of them, and to husband them well while they laſt; Of them then who give over at the firſt ſucceſſes they obtaine, and ſtop at th' Entry of their proſperity; ſome of them are aſtoniſhed at their happineſſe, and inſomuch that they have been forced into th' Haven, and that they did not bring themſelves thither; They dare not any more put forth to Sea. They content themſelves with what they have gained.
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:99746:91"/>They will not put their Reputation to Reference, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble certaine perſons who having leapt over by night, or in th' exceſſe of a paſſion, a very large ditch or ſome very dangerous paſſage, are raviſhed with what they had done upon ſight thereof by day, or that their ſouls are ſunk, and are not bold enough t' attempt the ſame. Action, after the conſideration of it; Others will taſte of the good which is hapned to them and rejoyce in the victory, and conſider not that in that time, th'Occaſions ſteale away from them, fortune retires, and th' Enemies gather ſtrength which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders them to march on. There are ſome, that decline not to do well ſo much by diſtruſt of their virtue, or by the weakeneſs of their Courage, as for feare of Envy; and had rather poſſeſſe in peace a Moderate reputation, than provoke that maligne paſſion which cauſeth us to be more afflicted for the good of others, then for our owne ills; and that even friends cannot behold the glory of their friends, if it be very high, nor ſuffer their Brightneſſe if it be very lively. Th' examples of what I have ſaid are but too ordinary. The <hi>Grecians</hi> have very often committed ſuch faults; and 'tis certaine that the Batteli of <hi>Salamina</hi> opened unto them the dore for the Ruine of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and for the Conqueſt of <hi>Aſia,</hi> if they had known their advantages, or if they had not been glutted with their ſucceſſe. The victory of <hi>Lepantha</hi> brought nothing to the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> which they had not before that warr. The moſt famous Battell that was ever gained upon the ſea was unfruitfull in their hands, all the gaine of the victorious, was, not to have been overcomed. The price of ſo memorable an action determined in it ſelfe, and gained no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from abroad, that Crowned it, and was its Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe. <hi>Charles the fifth</hi> alſo as Great a perſon as he was, forgot himſelfe after the journey of <hi>Pavia;</hi> an if in the Conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation wherein <hi>France</hi> was fallen, for th' Impriſonment of their <hi>King,</hi> and for a ſtroak ſo little expected; He had aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted our frontiers, He had not met with any Reſiſtance. He had not, it may be, left Rivalls to his nephews; and had paid himſelfe by his hands the ranſome of his priſoner. The <hi>King</hi> did not handle it ſo after the reliefe of <hi>R<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>é,</hi> nor corrupt the fruits of that victory for want of purſuite. It was truly much to have performed an action which was held almoſt for a miracle, and to gaine an end of what was eſteemed Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible. It was much to have revenged ſo many affronts th' <hi>Engliſh</hi> had heretofore done us, and purged the ſhame of the loſſes of <hi>Creci</hi> &amp; of <hi>Poitiers</hi> after two ages. But it had not been enough for the <hi>King</hi> if he ſtayed there, and though th' Effect was great, It was not reaſonable for a <hi>Prince</hi> to retire whoſe
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:99746:92"/>forces were ſtrong, &amp; to whom ſo much remained to be done.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Conſideration, and which is a neceſſary ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel of the firſt; is th' Incounter of the time the <hi>King</hi> made choice of, very ſeaſonable for that ſiege. The choice it may be of the time, is the greateſt ſecret in Affaires, and moſt powerfull Meanes to make them proſper. <hi>Caeſar</hi> did ſupreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poſſeſſe it, and it was one of the words of <hi>Charles the fifth</hi> and of <hi>Philip</hi> his ſon, <hi>I and the Time to Two others.</hi> Theſe words may admit of too Interpretations; <hi>Th' one</hi> is to know, how t'order a man ſelfe in the time of ill fortune; To ſtrike ſaile when the Tempeſt is too ſtrong; not t' oppoſe ones ſelfe to the violence of a deſtiny provoked. T' avoid the ſtroakes with dexterity which cannot be reſiſted in a ſtreight line; To put them by, to caſt ourſelves on Quarter, and t' obſerve th' occaſion of ſome favourable Revolution, and of a better adventure. <hi>Charles the fifth</hi> gives that Counſell to his ſon in th' inſtruction he left him, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to make better uſe of it then any people in the world. He practiſed it at the peace of <hi>Paſſo,</hi> which had been ſhamefull to th' <hi>Empire</hi> if the Neceſſity had not rather made it, then th' Inclination of th' <hi>Emperour.</hi> He practiſed it at the peace of <hi>Soiſſons,</hi> where the want of money interrupted the proſperity of his armes, and he was conſtrained to offer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for Hoſtage to the <hi>Germans,</hi> who without that had a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne to ſeize upon him; The <hi>Spaniards</hi> practiſed it alſo ſome two yeares ſince at the peace of <hi>Suza,</hi> and they diverted in flying, the ſtorme, which did threaten them, and reſtrained the Thunder which was ready to fall on them, if they had not humbled themſelves. The Truce which we made the laſt yeare at <hi>Carignan,</hi> when the plague defected our armies, and that the warr was the leaſt of the Flailes of th' anger of God, was a ſtroake of that addreſſe, and gave us meanes to prepare for the Reliefe of <hi>Caſal,</hi> and to ſave <hi>Italy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Th' <hi>other</hi> Interpretation, is, to know how to make choice of the beſt time to make an Enterprize. For 'tis true, there's a certaine Moment in time, and a certaine Encounter of cauſes in affaires, which being paſſed they returne no more together, and 'tis to no purpoſe t' attend th' Effect, when the Cauſes ceaſe. Th' <hi>Italians</hi> have called it very aptly <hi>Conjunct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure,</hi> but it was not poſſible to find a more favourable then that under which the ſiege of <hi>Rochell</hi> was formed. That towne was almoſt without a Garriſon, th' <hi>Engliſh</hi> had emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied it of Victualls. <hi>Holland</hi> durſt not ſend it but a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſavoured Releeſe, and by Conſequent weake. <hi>England</hi> which we had ſo ill handled, could not ſend any but fearefull per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and the Rebells were reduced t' expect more from th'
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:99746:92"/>Elements then from Men, and from out Impatience then from their Force. The third Conſideration is th' Enterprize of the <hi>Ditch,</hi> and th' Acceptation of the propoſition which was then made; It muſt be Confeſſed, that there was uſe of an extraordinary virtue for a worke without Example, and there was not leſſe need of Light and underſtanding to Comprehend the poſſibility, then of fire and Courage to propoſe the Means of reducing it in Act, and t'overcome the difficulties which were not ordinary; <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Antwerpe</hi> have nothing ſeen of like, whatſoever is ſaid, unleſſe, it may be, they will Compare the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea with th' Ocean, and a ſtraight and quiet Channell with a Channell extreamly Agitated, and unmeaſurably Large.</p>
                  <p>In the Matter of theſe novelties, There are that doe generally reject all of them, by reaſon of the vanity that is found in many, and who had rather beleeve nothing then expoſe themſelves to the ſhame of being too Credulous. Tis to have too little Judgment, or too great a diſtruſt of ones ſelfe; and in th' Affaires of the world, Th' univerſall Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes are not ever to be followed which are ſometimes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull, though they are many times true. But a great Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of State ought to know how to diſtinguiſh what is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly falſe; from what hath ſome apparence of true, and what is feaſable from what is Impoſſible. 'Tis not that 'tis neceſſary that He poſſeſſe all th' Arts with the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, as they who make profeſſion but of one; But it ſufficeth that he know them in ſuch a degree, and with ſo juſt a light, that he may ſecure himſelfe, from th' Impoſture though it be very ſubtile, and obſerve what is good though it be not very excellent.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>fourth</hi> Conſideration, that th' Enterprize of the <hi>Ditch,</hi> is th' Evidence of an extreame vaſt ſoul, and of a Courage not diſtaſted by Difficulties, nor wearied by Time. Th' <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours</hi> of the <hi>French</hi> are ordinarily too lively to langniſh after a deſigne. They will ſuddenly ſee, th' End, or abandon it; what they carry not at the firſt Aſſault, rebukes them: The ſtroaks they loſe, weakens them as much as thoſe they receive; and their proper Impetuoſity tyres them not leſſe then the Reſiſtance of what they Aſſault. But the <hi>king</hi> hath made it appeare in this occaſion whereof I ſpeake, that hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not the vices of the <hi>French,</hi> he had in an Eminent degree the virtues of other Nations; and that he had a very great Boldneſs t'undertake and Conſtancy to purſue it, and Patience to finiſh it; The firſt ſpoile the Sea made upon the <hi>Ditch,</hi> had ſhaken any other Courage but his, and the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the Equinoctialls had daunted an Imagination
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:99746:93"/>leſſe firme: but He believed, that the feare which might fall into the ſoules of Men commonly conſtant, ought not to fall into his, and that it was too little for his power and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune t'overcome Men, if he did not alſo reſiſt the force of the ſtarrs, and Elements, and what nature hath of moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous and rapid. There are affaires which muſt be aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned ſo ſoon as they are begun either in regard of their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility or that they ſerve for hinderance to better and more profitable deſignes. And 'tis true, that t' opinionate in this, is a Manifeſt imprudence. That the ſhorteſt follies are the beſt, and that the further a Man goes when he is out of the right way, the more he wanders. There are others which are infinitely important, and are but difficult; and of them an end muſt be had whatſoever they coſt, or periſh or carry them. After that th' <hi>Earle of Fuentes</hi> had beſieged <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bray,</hi> and reduced that City to the Tearms of being taken or of rendring; <hi>Sr. of Vie</hi> entred with ſome Releefe. So ſoon as he was Entred, he changed all th' order of the defence, and ſpoiled th' Enemies by the faults they had committed in beginning the Seige. He diſmounted their Cannon with his; He made their Batteries to flye with his Mines; He rendred unprofitable a part of their Labours, and did Incommodate them in ſuch manner, that it was propoſed in the Councell of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> either to raiſe the ſiege or to begin it againe, and give it another forme. <hi>Th' Earle</hi> of <hi>Fuentes</hi> knew well th' Errour, which had been committed in the beginning; and that the ſheep wherewith he had to do were the ſame, but that they were governed by another Shepheard, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that he proteſted that he would dye there rather then retire, and that he had rather be obſtinate in overcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Difficulties which were there in continuing the firſt deſigne, then diſcover his Imprudence in quitting it, and take by that Meanes courage from the ſouldiers, and Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation from his Armes. When <hi>Caeſar</hi> had laid downe before <hi>Alexia</hi> or <hi>Vercingentorix,</hi> it was ſhut up with four and twenty thouſand Men to defend it. He ſaw come upon him four hundred thouſand fighting Men which came to beſiege him, and ſuch a fearefull Cloud of Men of warr to ſurround him. That nevertheleſſe did not trouble him, and inſomuch that the Queſtion was of the deciſion of a great Affaire, and that he would with one onely Blow affright all the body of the <hi>Gaules,</hi> He reſolved upon a bold Charge, He did not abandon the ſiege and marched to meet th' Enemies which drew to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him; He defeated them, and compelled the beſieged t'yeeld, and <hi>Vercingentorix</hi> t' humble itſelfe, and to lay its greatneſſe at his feet; which they could not preſerve with all
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:99746:93"/>the force of the <hi>Gaules;</hi> And after that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized <hi>Amiens,</hi> The dead <hi>King,</hi> did he not reſolve to loſe himſelfe or retake it; T'hazard rather all his State, then to ſuffer that breach to remaine, open; and that it was begun in a place which diſcovered th' heart, and left nothing ſecure even to the Gates of <hi>Paris.</hi> This proceeding appeared at firſt a little ſtrange, and ſeems t' hold more of Deſpaire then of force, and of obſtinacy then Conſtancy. That nevertheleſs is not ſo, and that which ſeems to be beyond the Limits of virtue, is not ever ſo but by Compariſon.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Limits are not fixed and immoveable. They have Many degrees according to th' abilities of them that exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe them: And th' Exceſſes which the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> permit t' <hi>Heroique</hi> virtue, and th' extreamities wherein they ſuffer, which ſhe paſſeth over; Are not Exceſſes or Extremities for her, but for th' ordinary virtues, and for the Common of Men. If they that ſerved the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Aniou</hi> in the ſiege of <hi>Rochell</hi> had had the faithfulneſſe of <hi>Sr. the Cardinall</hi> or his prudence, if they had loved the Good of the State ſo well as he, and the Reputation of their Maſter; They had not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed him to riſe at the Evening of taking of it, and to give the victory that was Ripe and ready to be gathered. They had rather imitated that <hi>Great Captaine,</hi> and had ſaid as th' other did at <hi>Garillan,</hi> That they knew of what Importance that Enterprize was to the <hi>King,</hi> and that it muſt be gained or periſh. But 'tis not of new Date; that there are people in the State which love Confuſion, and who Imagine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be like <hi>Phyſicians</hi> who ſhould not be Conſiderable without the ſins of nature, nor in honour if there were not ſick perſons.</p>
                  <p>The proſperities of the <hi>King</hi> ſtop not at the taking of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chell;</hi> our Armes were inſtantly beyond the Mountaines, and <hi>Caſall</hi> ſaw its deliverance at the ſole noiſe of our paſſage. That unheard-of Quickneſs equally ſurprized our Allyes and enemies, and thoſe who believed, that the Conqueſt we had newly made, was of the kind of thoſe victories, which make the victor to weep; would never have imagined that without tireing or taking breath, we went to force th' <hi>Alpes</hi> in the midſt of winter, and ſeek beyond the Mountaines a new harveſt of glory. The Rebells of <hi>Languedoc</hi> immediately after ſaw the <hi>King</hi> with them, and we have ſeen in leſſe then two Months all the places rendred or taken, and thoſe feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Baſtions which have conſumed twenty yeares labour, and the wealth of that party, humble themſelves to his powers. Tis that virtue, which the <hi>Romans</hi> called <hi>Celerity,</hi> and which we call <hi>Quickneſs</hi> wherewith <hi>Caeſar</hi> made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:99746:94"/>Maſter in 40 dayes, of <hi>Italy:</hi> in 60, of <hi>Spain;</hi> and in leſſe then three yeares of all that which <hi>Rome</hi> had Conquered in more then ſeven hundred yeares. 'Tis with that virtue, that <hi>Gaſtan</hi> of <hi>Foix</hi> in leſſe then ſix weeks relieved <hi>Bologua;</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated the <hi>Venetians</hi> at <hi>Villa Franca;</hi> retook <hi>Breſſe,</hi> and gained the battell of <hi>Ravenna.</hi> This is to know how to make uſe of the victory, but in in an admirable Manner. 'Tis to ſayle as long as there is any wind; 'Tis to ſecond <hi>Fortune;</hi> 'Tis to make uſe of th' <hi>occaſion.</hi> There's glory in acting a number of great things; but this a marvell to performe them in a little time, and to place in a ſmall intervall, th' Actions that will honour the courſe of many yeares; one victory neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe begets another, and as a needle rub'd with th'Adamant attracts many; Proſperities tread upon th'heeles of one another, Provided that men give not over: That they are the ſame Chiefes that governe, and the ſame ſouldiers that act, and the ſame diſcipline that doth exerciſe them.</p>

                  <p>But as boldneſſe, diſcipline and obdience are the virtues of ſouldiers; Prudence, Conduct, and conſtant Meditation of the Meanes which cauſe the victory are the virtues of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:99746:95"/>and Generalls of Armies, 'Tis with theſe Qualities that they ought to diſtinguiſh themſelves from them that are under them. Theſe are properly the forme of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion; They do conſtitute the difference. Courage, and the Contempt of death are not, to ſpeake properly, but the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and the Matter; and ther's not ſo much glory for a Chief to go to blowes, t' enter upon dangers when he muſt, and when the occaſion preſſeth, as there would be ſhame Not to do it; That would be more pardonable in a ſingle ſouldier, whoſe wounds are the ſprings of proverty and miſery, than in great perſons to whom they are Characters of honour, and the ſeeds of Immortality; which give them place in Hiſtory whoſe markes are venerable in th' eyes of a <hi>Prince,</hi> and in th' eyes of the people, and adorne them better then all their Ornaments and precious ſtones. It ſhould be a ſtrange thing if the moſt illuſtrious profeſſion of the world, and the nobleſt of all the functions of life, which is that of Commanding Armies; ſhould be ſo eaſie, as that there were no more to do then to run to death and to caſtones ſelfe into danger to make him Worthy. There would be too eaſie a bargaine had of eternity which it promiſeth, and the <hi>Gladiators</hi> might more lawfully pretend to, it, then thoſe exalted ſoules which prepare themſelves for it with great Cares: who make the boldneſſe of Reaſon to deſcend to th'heart, and who make that divine part, the principle of their Conduct, and of all their Actions.</p>
                  <p>If <hi>Caeſar</hi> had had but Courage in the degree he had it, and that violent heat that gathers about th'heart at the ſight of danger; He had not effaced the glory of other <hi>Romans;</hi> many had been found to have equalled him in that thing, and <hi>Coriolanus, Capitolinus, Marcellus, and Catiline</hi> alſo had diſputed th'Advantage with him. Courage alone had not rendered <hi>Epaminondas</hi> the chiefe perſon of <hi>Greece;</hi> and <hi>Pelopidas,</hi> and <hi>Leonidas,</hi> and many others, had not yeelded unto him in the Reſolution of dying for their Country. <hi>Ferrant Gonſalve</hi> had an admirable prudence, and, as it was ſaid of <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> That it was not known which of two Qualities prevailed moſt in him, Knowledge or Valour. For my part I make it a queſtion whether <hi>Epaminondas</hi> was the greater Captaine or Counſellour, whether he was more Capable to governe an Army, or to guide a Negotiation; And more proper to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due Men or gaine them. And to ſpeake of ours; <hi>Gaſton</hi> of <hi>Foix</hi> had Courage, and Good ſenſe equally raiſed in him. He acted at leaſt as much with the laſt as with th'other. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of th' Army of <hi>Italy</hi> againſt that of the League was given him, not as to the moſt Famous, but as to the moſt
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:99746:95"/>Capable, and he did not ſo much ſuſtaine the dignity of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall by reaſon of the ſplendor of his Race, as by reaſon of the Merit of his perſon. I will give you two examples which will make it appeare, That he was truly in all ſenſes th'Head of his army; and had a Wit ſuperiour t' all them that obeyed him. When he went to releeve <hi>Bologna,</hi> he manadged that deſigne with ſo great ſecreſy, that he was on the way before his Army doubted it, and was within it before his Enemyes knew it; At the journey of <hi>Ravenna</hi> he alone ordered and diſpoſed of the Battell. Of three bodies which compoſed it, He choſe not one of them to command. He reſerved onely for himſelfe a Troop of voluntary Gentlemen to be free, and to charge where there ſhould be need. I ſpeake not of his eloquence; 'Tis ſufficient to ſay, that it lives yet with honour in hiſtory; and hath been admired of ſtrangers, and of them alſo who eſteem'd us Barbarous. It muſt be confeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that that <hi>Prince</hi> at th' Age of 22 years wherein he died was a compleat Man, and that no life was ſo ſhort and more glorious then his. Th'head then and the good ſenſe are more neceſſary for a Generall of an Army, then Armes and impetuoſity; and 'tis foreſight that begets the victory, rather then courage. 'Tis ſtudy, Meditation, and conference which ought to prepare the great Perſon whereof I ſpeak; and tis the Practique and Experience which finiſh and compleat them. For that reaſon, It was ſaid of <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver man knew ſo much and ſpake ſo little. 'Tis not that he eſteemed ſilence a great virtue, as ſome have interpreted, nor that he preferred it to ſpeech conducted by good ſenſe; But 'tis that, in effect, he alwayes tumbled up and down ſome great deſigne in his Braine; That he thought of raiſing <hi>Thebes</hi> of humbling <hi>Sparta,</hi> and of ſubduing the <hi>Grecian people,</hi> which to his time had been invincible.</p>
                  <p>How excellent <hi>Sr. the Cardinall</hi> is in this Matter; How active and lively his Reaſon is; how infallible and juſt his providence, and how efficacious the diſpoſition of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct; Lets not amuſe at words to declare it, and let's lend nothing of ſtrange to a truth that hath no need of it; lets add nothing to th'effects, and to what hath been touched or ſeen but a naturall Repreſentation; let's leave th' Artifices, and painting for moderate Beauties and for Common vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues. For this effect, I will content my ſelfe to ſpeake of the ſecond warre of <hi>Italy,</hi> wherein he particularly preſided, and whereof he had the principall government under th' Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicious Planets of his maſter; I ſay then, that it had been much to make a great Army ſubſiſt in <hi>Piedmoat,</hi> if the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try had been favourable to us, if abundance had been in all
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:99746:96"/>places, and in a ſeaſon when the paſſages had been eaſie to us. But to make it live in th' enemies Country, and where all men and all things were Contrary to us. In a ſeaſon when Barrenneſſe was in <hi>France,</hi> and proviſions were to paſſe the Mountaines, when ſnows were at th' higheſt; It muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged that it belongs not to a vulgar Providence to ſtrike ſuch ſtroakes. It was to ſupply by his Wit and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct what was wanting to the nature of things. And the <hi>Marquis</hi> of <hi>Spinola</hi> who never thought it, ſeemed to have Reaſon to ſay, that he who had moſt proviſions would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine victorious in that warr. He believed infallibly t' have that advantage over us, having th' Earth, and Sea for him, knowing that our Country Men are enemies t'orders, without which armies ſuffer in the midſt of abundance, and wherewith they ſubſiſt intirely in the midſt of want. He remembred that at the warr of <hi>Genes,</hi> th' army of the dead Conſtable was vexed with hunger though it was ſmall. Though it had <hi>Piedmont</hi> in its favour and made warre onely for th' Intereſts of the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Savoy;</hi> But when he ſaw, that we reſiſted thoſe great incommodities; That we had found Remedies againſt thoſe evills and new Inventions to carry the proviſions; 'Tis then he confeſſed the <hi>French</hi> had changed their humours, or at leaſt that the ſheep were the ſame, but governed by other Shepheards. Theſe things truly are great, and have been worthy of admiration from our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and of them wh'admire not much but themſelves. But they are not nevertheleſſe the Maſter-peece of <hi>Sr. the Cardinals</hi> induſtry, nor the great effect of his prudence. The preparatives for the releaſe of <hi>Caſal</hi> are a peece moſt Illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Magnificent. And as the works of the leaſt eize are more ingenious then th' other, and that 'tis more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult for an artificer to make a work of a ſmall volume to proſper then a greater. In like manner the foreſight which operates much in little time, and in a ſhort intervall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playes a very large Matter; is of a price, and Gonſideration more exalted then that which is acted at great leiſure, which hath a free field t'extend itſelfe, which hath no bounds to Conſtraine it, and which is not oppreſſed by the brevity of time, and by the greatneſs of its object. To raiſe thirty thouſand men in leſſe then ſix weekes; Make them March through <hi>France</hi> and over the Mountaines during that time; Give order for all neceſſaries; T' enable them to live, and ſubſiſt; To ſend them to a Country ſpoiled with Contagion, and into places where the plague might give feare to them, that did not feare men; againſt powerfull Enemies covered with Retrenchments and ſtrong holds; defended by a caſtell,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:99746:96"/>and a Town; In a time when the diſgrace the <hi>Venetians</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived at <hi>Valeſe,</hi> ad th'unhappy ſucceſs of their Armes. The ſurprize of <hi>Mantova</hi> which had ſomewhat of fatall, and inimaginable. The rendring of the Town and <hi>Caſtell</hi> of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall;</hi> had put all our friends into deſpaire, and the greateſt part of the <hi>French</hi> into aſtoniſhment. Add to that th' Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices uſed by ſome ill <hi>Frenchmen</hi> to ruine the <hi>Kings</hi> deſignes and th' honour of <hi>France.</hi> The traverſes they raiſed within; which were the more dangerous that they were ſecret and ſilent, and reſembled the Mines, which make them leape who march upon them without ſuſpition or defiance. And what was moſt fatall and of ill augury the <hi>Kings</hi> ſickneſs and the deſpaire of his recovery. This ſad accident which might alone have troubled a weaker ſpirit then the <hi>Cardinal</hi>'s, for th'unhappy State of our affaires, and of our Allyes; and for the revolution it had cauſed in the generall order of the World, and in his particular fortune. That this black Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction and ſo many Inconveniences linked together did not diſturbe his judgment nor abate his action. That the neceſſary proviſions for the Releefe fo <hi>Caſall</hi> were provided. That <hi>Caſall</hi> was relieved; If th'unhappineſſe of this time permitted me to ſpeak a bold truth, and if his modeſty of whom I ſpeak would not be offended, I would ſay that ſince <hi>Caeſar's</hi> time the world hath not ſeen a ſtronger Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, more reſolute or wiſer; and if that had hapned in the time of the Common-wealth of <hi>Rome</hi> or of old <hi>Greece,</hi> that it had been one of the faireſt Monuments of their Hiſtory, and one of the moſt famous Inſtances of their policy.</p>
                  <p>I will not conceale a very remarkable Condition in the Conduct of <hi>Sr. the Cardinal.</hi> 'Tis that he prepares alwayes, if he be not hindered, meaner which ſeem immeaſurable and too powerfull to produce th'End which he propoſeth t' himſelfe. 'Tis properly t'employ Exceſſe t'hinder defect. 'Tis to part very early not to faile the arrivall at the journeyes end. 'Tis t' have a remainder, t' avoid having too little 'Tis not t' act ſingly, but infallibly. 'Tis in a word the Country Cuſtome of th' ordinary humour of the <hi>French.</hi> To whom th'heat of temper and vivacity of imagination alwayes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent th'Enterprizes more eaſie and of leſſe durance they they are in effect. Moreover the preparations they make are ever leſſe and weaker then the nature of th' Enterprize requires, according alſo to the proportions they have ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, and according to the Meaſure of their apprehenſion. Wherefore they are conſtrained to retire in the midſt of their Courſe, and all things faile them, when they have moſt need, and in the ſtrength of th'Affaire.</p>
                  <pb n="184" facs="tcp:99746:97"/>
                  <p> This indiſcreet proceeding and tumultuary faſhion of act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hath been cauſe of infinite evils which have vexed <hi>France.</hi> That they have often ſtirred ill humours which were left be hind without purging of them away; that ſo many faire Beginnings we have had in the warrs, had not' anſwerable ends; And in a word, that we have not known to conſerve th'advantages we had gained, nor keep the Conqueſts which we had made. <hi>Sr. the Cardinal</hi> carried himſelf in another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and kept another way, when it was neceſſay t' force th' <hi>Alpes,</hi> and to break the <hi>Barricado's,</hi> which oppoſed the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Caſal</hi> and the liberty of <hi>Italy;</hi> He adviſed the <hi>King</hi> to march thither with an army, capable to ſubdue all <hi>Italy,</hi> and to paſſe from <hi>Suza</hi> to <hi>Ofrante.</hi> So truly the Reputation of thoſe great forces, did impart th'effect which we aimed at: It acted farr off, and all alone; it began't overcome ſo ſoon as it began to march; and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> who it may be had mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to meet us, and had diſputed all the paſſages with us, if we had been weak; durſt not attend us in their trenches of <hi>Caſal,</hi> and did not believe that there was ſafety for them in the <hi>Caſtle</hi> of <hi>Milan</hi> but by a treaty of peace. This ſerved to pull up by the roots the Rebellion of <hi>Languedoc</hi> and to lay flat a Party, which had long Rooting in this Province; ſix armies were ſeen at one inſtant to be drawn out againſt them; and that diviſion of Forces which took away the ſprings of Reliefe, and Communication to the rebell-townes. In ſhort the <hi>Cardinal</hi> knew that the firſt Maxime of warr is, <hi>That who layes out most, layes out leaſt.</hi> That the petty frugalities which are made out of time, are certaine loſſes of what is advanced, that 'tis not to ſow with hope to gather, but not to ſeem to do nothing; and that they who give ſuch cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous Counſells in neceſſary occaſions, ſeek not ſo much the good of th' affaires of their Maſter, as not to loſe the matter of doing their owne buſineſſe.</p>
